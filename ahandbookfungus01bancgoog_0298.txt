the bean ration 9 pounds beans, 8.5 pounds out straw. Thestraw

The average weight of the three horsea during the whole experi-
ment was, for eorn periods 9788 end for bean periods 1,045.5
pounds The increase in weight was partly due to the larger
quantity in nutriente of the bean ration, amounting 10 01101116 per
00111 In spite of the larger quantities 01 nutriente fed during the
