According to Oolin the liver 01 the horse forms over 13 pounds
01 bile, the ox ni, and the sheep ‚75 pounds each 24 bours The
flov 01 bile is continuone, increasing somewhat as the food passes
into the 810011 intestine. Bile contains a ferment in small amount,
capable of converting staroh into sngar. Its moin 080 18 10 aid
