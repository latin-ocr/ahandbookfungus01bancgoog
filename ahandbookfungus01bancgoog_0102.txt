Bytho table we learn that ieedlng hone meai or hard-wood
mhes to pigs otherwise confined to a corn-meal diet effected n
sowing 01 23 per cent. in the corn requiredfor100pounds of

meai to pigs otherwise living wholly on corn, the strength 01 the
thigh bonos was about double that 01 pigs not allowed bone meai
or ashes It was finther found that when the bones were hurned‚
those 01 the pigs getting ashes or bone mea] contained about 50
per cent. more ssh than the others This latter feet was suh
