next tirno oi feoding should ho reduced accordingly. As a rulo,
it will bo saleto foed as much as the horse will eat with apparent
relish3 and then, with plenty of exorciso, he will not become
overlondod with iat The hay, as well as tho grain foed, should
ho sound and free from mould and dust, and the stall should bo
kept clean, well lightod and perfectly ventilatod.

“ Tho amount oi exorciso to bo given will vary somewhat with
tho condition and habit oi the horso If ho bo in thin flesh, and
it is thought best to fatten him up, tho exorciso should be lighter
than it otherwise would bo; and, on the other hand, ii there isa
, tondency to booomo too iat, this may bo corrected by increasing tho

shoer nonsenso. Anything that adds to tho health, strength and
vigor oi tho horse will increase his virility or soxual power,
simply because the sexnal organs will partako oi tho general tone
