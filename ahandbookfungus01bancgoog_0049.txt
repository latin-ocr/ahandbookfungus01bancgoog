Diyoetfmt, Respirotion ond werimum. 35

From these data we learn that in twenty-four hours the steer took
into the blood by way of tho lungs 16 pounds of oxygen‚ and
into the alimentary traot 27.ss pounds of dry matter and 128
pounds of water, or 171.8 pounds in all.

57. waste prodam— 'Phe second division of the table treats
of productiori and waste. Iret us first oonsider the waste by the
stesr for the day during whioh the study was eonduoted. 'l'he
lom to the body through tho several ohannels was as follows:

Pounds.
Passedoff assolidexorement ........................... 89.4
Passed off as urine ......................................... 30.6
Paoeed off as respiration products ..................... 49.5

Total wastafrom body ........................... sss}

This shows that there passed from tho steen as solid excrement
89.4 pounds, of urina 30.6 ponnds, while from the lungs there
were given off 49.5 pounds of waste products, somewhat more
than one-half of which was water, and a little less than half oar·
bonio aoid Tho total outgo from the body for the day under
study, was as shown above, 169.5 pormds

'l'ho deoomposition of nitrogeuous substantes in the body is
ealoulated from the quantity of nitrogen in the urina. As pro-
tein oontains 16 por oent. nitrogen on the average, the quantity
of protoin oorresponding to the nitrogen in the urine is found by
multiplying by11⁰0⁰, or by 635. Tho table shows that there were
,170ki10gra1ns of nitrogen in the urine of the ox. Multiplying
this by 635, there renutsioffl kilograms or 238 pounds This
sum mensures both the quantity of nitrogenous nutrients taken
into tho body from the food, and tho body tissues which were
broken down and left the body ns waste during the day of the trial.

58. nest modoetien- From the above we have tha following

in relation to the income and outgo of the body of the steer for
' one day:

Pounds.
Total substance passing into the body ................ 171.8

'l'otal waste leaving the body ............................ 169.5

Amonnt retained in the body .................. ³—le
