101. Coro 0000000010.- The use of corn in the manufacture of
starch‚ gluoosc, beer, spirits, ete, has grown enormously oi lale,
resulting in great quantities of hyproducts of high feoding value
for stoch. In most of the prodesses of manufactum the first step
is to secure the starch 01 the corn grain as free as possible from
the other constituente. 'Phe composition of the corn grain in its
different parts and the various bypmduots lelt in the manufacture
have been studied by Voorhees at the Now Jemey Station,⁸ a
summary of his findings being as follows: 'Phe husk or skin
which covers the corn kernel consists of two layers, which on
removal constitute what is known as corn bran3 this contains
practioally all the crude fiber 01 the oorn graia Below the husk
or skin loyor, but near the outside of the grain, comes a loyor 01
cells rich in gluten or protein, yellow in color, and not reodily
separable from the remainder of the hemel. Most of the pro
tein 01 the corn grain lies in this layer. Ncar the bose of the
grain is the germ, which also contains gluten, and is particularly
rich in oil and mineral matters. 'l'he body ol the corn grain
proper iscomposed almost entirely of starch, the cells being
packed to repletionthcrcwith. Voorhees separated 100 grams ot
corn hemels into skin, germ and starch portione, and analyzing
these secured the results presented in the following table:
