began. In this ease there was a greater decomposition 01 proteiu
into uren and fat, with a smaller absorption of oxygen, and con·
sequently a decressed oxidation of the fat, both processes com-
bining to produce iat in the body. The muscles of the poisoned
dog contained 424 p'er cent. 01 fat, and the liver 30 per cent, or
three times more then was present in the normal nutrition 01 tho

dog, and at least ten times more than would have been found aiter
twenty days 01 starvation, if phosphorus had not been administered.

According te Henneberg,² 100 pounds cf protein will form
33.45 pounds 01 uren on decompositiom the remainder, ecte
ponnds, aiter unitiugwith 123 parts of water, mcy form 514
pounds of fat and 214 pounds 01 carbonic aeid. 'Phe maximum
quantity 01 fat which protein can form under the most favorable
conditions is, therefore, ani per cent.

III. Formatioc of Fet ia the Body.

79. Conceminp 101.- Having ascertained the sources 01 fat in
the animal body, we next consider the principles governing its
formation and consurnption. The formation of fat in the body
will take place when the supply of nutriente in the foed exceeds
the immediate demands 01 11ιο system. Το study the effect 01
single nutriente on sat formation and consumption, we follow the
plan employed in the stndy of protein consumption, and investi-
gate the conditious which are most favorable to the formation 01
fat in the animal body and least favorable to its consumption.

80. lesdinp with fat nlone.— While exclusive protein feeding
induces only protein consumption in the body, and does not een·
tribute to the formation 01 fiesh, an exclusive fat diet has no
influence on the decomposition 01 fat inthe body, the same amount
being deposited whether much or little fat is fed. A dog experi-
rncuted with by Pettenkofer and Voit lost 96 grams of fat daily dur·
ing hrmger. When 100 grams 01 fat were fed daily, an average of
ili granis 01 fat was cxidized‚ showing that the loss of fat in the
body vas barely covered by the feeding 01 fat.² A relativcly
larger decomposition cf fat takes place in the bodies 01 very fat
