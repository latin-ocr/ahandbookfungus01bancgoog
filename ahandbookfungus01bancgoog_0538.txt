operatione at an early bour in winter, preferring not to disturb
their animale until the day breaks Usually grain is first given,
followed by hay and water. 'Phe trough in whieh grain is ied
should be kept elean at all times, and there should be ample roem,
that eaeh animal may get its share of grain. Nowhere does the
skill oi tho feeder show more plainly than in getting sheep to full
grain foed without a member oi the floek getting “off seed.”

Western sheep may not be able to take over one-tenth of a pound

oi grain per day at first. 11 so, two months or ten weeks may be
required in getting the flook to full foed. English mutton sheep
take to grain more readily, and in some oases no more than three
or four weeks need intervene between starting and iuli feeding.
In no ease should this operation be hurried, ior it means waste oi
seed and the permanent injmy ii not loss of some os the animala
