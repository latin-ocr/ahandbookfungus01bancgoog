-extrocts from the mult the soluble dextrin and sugur. The liquor
containing this is called wort, which upon pnoper fermentation

brewers' grains, s hyproduct of great volume ct ull broweries
It is evident from this presentaticn thot the hrewer who uses only
the stureh cf the hurley gruin does not cere for varieties cl grain
rich in protein, but rather the contrary. According tc Richard-
son, Mitroker found that e first-cluss multing borley should not
carry over 8. 67 per cent protein, which is ubout two-thirds thnt
found in American gruins. 'Phe requirementscf the stockmmr
who sccks feeds rich iu protein are in the opposite directior, sc
that the poorest burley for multing moy be the best for feeding.
Lightcolored‚ bright burley makes beer of better color then durh,
westher-steined gruins3 hence the lower price poid hythe nautor
for westher-steiued barley.
