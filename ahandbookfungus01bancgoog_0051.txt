the 228 pounds oi increase. We learn from the above that
during oue day oi the experimeut the ox took into its body 171.8
pouuds ol material in exygen, water and dry matter, aud from it
built up 228 pounds oi body substance, which consisted oi .48
pouuds of albuminoids or leau meat, ,61 pounds ol fat, ,02
pounds oi mineral matter, which went mainly to the bones, aud
1.17 pounds oi water, placed mostly with the lean meat and, in
lm proportiou, with the fatty tissue

Where the animm produces other subsenoes thau flesti, as in
the ocae oi sheep and milch oows, the method of calculating ·
production is the same es with oxcn, though somewhat more
complicated.

60. Measnrlop the beat unm ot taeda-'Phe calorimeter is a
device so arranged that when a given substance is burued therein
tbe heat given off is taken up by water aud can be accmately
ascertained. While investigatione have been in progress with
the respiration apparatus to determine what becomes ot the tood
taken into the body, other workers have endeavored by means of
the salorimeter to ascertain the heat units oi food materiata It
has been found that the resulta obtained with the respiration
apparatus and the calorimeter agree very closely5 that is to say,

' in supplying the body with fuel, the protein, fat aud carbohy-

drates oi the iood have been found to replacc each other iu admo&
exact proportior to the beat units'they evolve when burning.
Pmc Riibuer found the quantity of material equal to 100 parts
of fat to be as follows:
