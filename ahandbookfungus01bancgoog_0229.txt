Thus we learn that roots cause a more watery carcass than do
dry feeds For breeding stock especially, and even for animale
in the early stages ol fattening, may not this point he one oi valuc

it lays on fat at small eost for lood cousumed Grues-fed steens are
iu tho best condition, because of such foed, to make rapid gains
when changed to more solid lood. A steer led roots during tho
first part of the iattening period should remain more vigorous and
make better gains for lood cousumed than one held ou dry seed
from start to fiuish. There is no doubt that tor breeding stook

by roots Il silage is not used, then let roots be fed, in a limited
way at least, to our sarm stock. When with dry seed we ean
