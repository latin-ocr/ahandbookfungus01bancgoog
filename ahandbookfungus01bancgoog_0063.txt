It follows, therefore, that in some of their funotions at least, amidos
may replaee albuminoids It has been found also by intimet
experimenta that equally good results have been obtained, where
amides have boen substituted ior part of the albuminoids in the
ration for growing animuls and miloh eows, as were obtained
when albuminoids only were fed In eorroboration of the above
we have the similar feeding vulue of oorn silage and a eorrespond-
iug ‘quantity of dry fodder eor-n. (ωδ) Silage often contains
nearly half its nitrogen in amide form, while dry fodder eoru
bus not more than from 12 to 15 per oent. of its nitrogen in the
form of amides

72. lnfloeuce of salt oa protelo consumption.— Experimento by
Voit with dogs, aud by Weiske with sheep, have shown that a
moderate addition of salt to the fodder inoreasos the aotivity of
the seoretion oi the body J'uioes and their oireulation, and oon·
sequently increases the proteiu consumption in the body. Salt
has a stimulating influenoe on the appetite of the animal, faeili·
tates tbe pamage of albuminoids from the digestive eanal into the

blood, aud in general inereases the euergy of the vital processus
'l'he feeding ol salt is therefore especially in plaoe with horsea,
young animab aud miloh oows when fed to their full oapaoity.

Another effect of salt is to inoreose the exoretion ol urine. If ‚
ustor supplying salt the animal is proveuted from drinking water,
then water whioh would otherwise pass off through tho lungs aud
skin will be diverted to the kidneys, aud if the supply from this
souree is not sufficient, water will further be drawn from the body
tissues 'Phe live weigbt of the animal ean therefore shrink
rapidly when salt is administered freely and little water is given,
ufterwurds when water is offered, muoh will be drank, and this,
returned to the digestive traot aud timues, will oause the animal
to increase rapidly in weight

73. lnfloence ol water on motolo coosooupdoa- Abnormally
large quantities ol water cause a waste of nutriente in the bodies
oi animala through inereased protein consumption. Voit has
shown an increase in protein oonsumptiou of 25 per oent. from

this souroe in ease of a fasting dog, and Henueberg found an
