3.9 per cent of the nitrogen supplied in its food, voiding 226 per

all, 96.1 per oent. of the nitrogen supplied this animal in his

stored in the body. This large retum of nitrogen seems reason·
able when we remember that during the lattening prooem the
grown ox adds little to his body besides iat, which we know oon·
