The prudent stockman, recognizing these habits of growth, with
alternate abundance and scarcity in food supply, realizes that he
must not rely entirely upon hlue-grass pastura for a uniform sup·
ply of nutrimant ior his cattle throughout tho whole scason. He
stocks the pasturas lightly iu spring so that the overplus herbage
oi May and June may remain to bo drawn upon during the dor-
mant period of midsommer, or, stocking his pasturas more heav-
ily, he anticipatos the midsummer shortage by providingaliberal
supply oi silage, green clover, green corn, or other forage crops.

knowledge, his stoclr suffers little or no loss from the usual mid·
summer shortage, hut grows steadily throughout the seusun.
