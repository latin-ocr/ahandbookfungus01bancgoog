vhe concentmtss for work horses can rarely oonsist wholly ui
oats because of their cust Rolled wheat and barley are excellent
substitutas, and corn meai, or preferably curn and cub meal, may
form* from one-third to oue-half ol the ration. Bran has come into
general use us part ieed ior the horse Shurts or middlings may
be used to the extent oi two or three pounds per day. This por-
tion oi the wheat grain is excellent for the horse, except that the
heavy ur floury middlings‚ ii fed in quantity, are liable to induce
colio with many horsea Cooked ieed may be given two ur three
times a weelr for cooling the system; in its absence, bran mashes
should be given. A small allowance oi roots is always in
order.

The work horse should be supplied with about two pounds oi
provender daily for each hundred punnds ol weight Oi this,
from ten tu eighwen pounds, according to the severity of the labor
performed, should be grain in some form 'Phe heavy ieeding
should come at night aiter the long day’s work is over and when
the animal has time ior masticating and digesting his iood. Alter
watering comes the administration of the grain, which should
constitute one-hali to two-thinis of the day’s allowance. unis
may be fed separately, or preferably upon moistened, chaffed hay.
'Phe amount of chaffed hay with which the grain is mixed should
not exceed une pech in volume.

Ground grain and chaffed hay are fed in mixed form that the
animal may masticate his food and pam it to the stomach more
quickly than is possible with the material whole and in dry form.
A fair allowance oi long hay should always be throwu into the
manger ior the animal to finish on, aiter the stomach isreplen·
iahed and while be is resting but still requiring more foed· The
morning meal should be comparatively light consisting mostly oi
grain with some chaffed hay. lt should not possess much bulk,
and should be in condition to be easily and rapidly consumed su
as to be well out of the way when the animal isled irum the
stabla 'Phe mid-day meal is omitted in many stabius, but most
horsemen hold that some grain should be given at noun, which
claim seems reasonable from our knowledge of the horse’s steinach
aud the digestiva process Iu any case the amount of seed given
at mid-day should not be large.
