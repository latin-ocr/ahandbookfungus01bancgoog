the food supplied to the enimsi is the productiori oi work. All
the manifestatione oi life, shown in ethousend weysby the animal,
ure in some manner derived from the food. The horse is kept for
tho direct productiori oi labor. The oow, in furnishing milk,
supplies a substanoe used for building up the tissues oi the body
orior the production of work. Doubtless the manner iu which
the iood is eonverted into energy will always exoeed men’s power
io definitely determine, but many laets in this connection already
known are interesting und highly insuuotive.

We have learned thet the substantes whieh enter the body as
iood ean be grouped under three great divisione: protein, carbo-
hydrutes, and ether extruet (7-9) We have further learned
thet when the protein oi the food has entered the body proper
und been broken down, the amount of this loss to the body ean
be measured by nitrogeu found iu the urea„ (57) The carbo-
hydrates and ether extruet, when absorbed from the alimentary
treet to nurture the body, may be built up into body fat or de-
eomposed into carbonis aoid end water, hest end energy being
given off in this prooess. The water resulting srom the deoom·
position cannot be used as e measure oi the broken-down cerbo-
hydretes end fut, for the reason that it is mingled with water
irom other souroes when exereted. Seientists are, newertheless,
able to determine the quantity of these substance whieh hasbeen
broken down, by measuring the cerbonio aeid exhaled in the
breuth oi the animal.
