American Stations have also endeavored to ascertain the money
value of concontratos according to the nutrients they conmin, with
the results presented in tho table below:

The data in the above table were secured in the following

manner: The market values oi all the concentmted feeding auus
in the state were tabulaed, together with the pounds of digestible
protein, carbohydrates and ether extract they conmined. Then
by a mathematical process the supposed relative value cf each of
the nutriente was determined with results presented in the table.
In Oonnectieut, for example, it was found that taking all the⁸
common concentrated sceding auus offered iu the market at cur-
rent valnas, each pound of digestible protein in these feeds eost
on the average 1.6 cents, one pound oi digestible sat a4 canu,
and a pound of digestible carbohydrates .96 cents Hills, Boyce
and Jones, of the Vermont Station, calculating the commercist
values of concontrates for their state, found by the process usually
employed that digestible iat had a value of - .19 cents, or that it
was worth less than nothingft an absurdity os course. Surprised
at this, they investigated the subject in a broad manner and came
to the conclusion that the method employed to determine these
values is inaccurate and without merit. At present it is impos-
sible tc state the value oi one foeding staff in terms of another
from calculatione based upon the nutrients contained in each.
