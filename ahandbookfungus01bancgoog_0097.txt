110. sirenem 01 nimbivoma-In the Wisoonsin and Kansas
trials the strength of the thigh-bones of the pige in the different
lois was determined in the following manner: The two ronnded
iren-supporting edges oi the testing machine were set four inches
apart, and on these the thigh-bones were placed, one at a time,
always in the same position. 'Phe ronnded ddge of the breaking
bar rested on the bone midway between the two supporta The
premere downward upon the bone, which was gradually increased,
was measured on the tiltingbeam of the machine, and the weight
which the bone supported at the time it broke was recorded. In
every instance the pige fed the protem-rien ration possemed the
strongest bonos, the differenoe often being very marked. For
example, in one Wisoonsin trial the bones o'i the corn-fed pige
broke at 380 ponnds on tho average, and those of the pigs fed
milk, blood and middlings at 1103 ponnds. 'l'bese waights ano for
each 100 ponnds of dressed caream, and show in favor of the
mixed ration by 32 per cent.

ΙΙΙ. What 11001γεί0 tevestem-In one of the Wisconsin trials
we went further into details, making partial analyses of some of
the body organa In this trial there were four pigs in each lot
'l'o the first lot was fed a ration consisting oi one-third dried
blood and two-thirds corn meal,· by wcight. The second lot
received one-half pen meal and one-half corn meal, while the
third was fed corn meal only. All lots received hard-wood ashes,
salt and water additional. The weights and gains oi the pige
