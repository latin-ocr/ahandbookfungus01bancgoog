The table oi seeding standands here presented is taken from
Mentael d Lengerke’s Iandm Kalender for 1898. It comprises
the standards originally prepared by Dr. Emit v. Wolff lor that
publication, modifled by Dr. 0. Iehmann. The standards hav-
ing been described at length in Chapter VII of this work, lit-tle
remeius to be added for the guidanoe of the student in their use.

'Phe standands are arranged to meet the requirements oi sarm
animala under normal conditione. The student should not aa·
cept the statements in the standands as absolute, but rather as
data oi a helptul nature, to be varied in practice as circumstances
suggest

ἶ Thestatements in the column headed “Dry Matter” should
be regarded as approximate only, since the digestiva treet of the
animal readily adapta itself to variatione oi 10 per cent or more
trem the standard of volume.

2 The eolumn headed “Sum oi Nutrieuts'' conrbines the data of
the three preceding columns, the ether extract being multiplied
by 24 before adding. In the first column ot this divisiones the
table, marked ‘¹ Cruda Fiber=l,” all the digestible nutriente are
included. In the second division, marked “ Grude riner=sssi it
is assumed that 30 per cent. oi the digestible non-nitrogenous
nutriente consiste oi crude fiber, and one-hali ot this, or 15 per
aaut, is deducted. This deduction should be made in thc' case
oi rations containing much course forage.

The standards are ior animale of normal siae. 'lhose oi small
breeds will require somewhat more nutriente, anrounting in some
cases to .3 oi a pound of nitrogenous and 1.5 pounds oi non-

nitrogenous digestible nutriente daily for 1,000 pounds oi live
aeight oi animala

Narrowing the nutritive ratio in ieeding full-grown animale is
ior the purpose ot lessening the depressiones digestibility, (51)
tn enliven the temperameut, orto increase the productiori oi milk
at the expense of laying on iat

The different mandarun given sor the same class oi animale

according to performance illustrate the manner and directior in
which desirable changes should be made.
