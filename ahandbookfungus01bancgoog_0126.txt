Reviewing his own and the work oi others, Oaldwell wrote:
“ The results of the many testa to which they (standard ratibus)
have been subjected at various places in the country make it
evident that with such data as we at present have at command,
no ration can be calculated that will do the same work or pro·
dirce the effect sor which it was calculated in all cases, and per·
haps not even in a majority of enses, and that sometimes such
rations entirely fail to accamplish the purpose for which they
were calculated and used.”

145. Kuehn‘s standard maintcnance ration- Investigaticns ex·
tending from 1882 to 1890 by G. Kiihn⁸ show that the full-grown
ox kept in perfect quiet in the stall can be maintained on .'!
poundsof digestible protein and 6.6 poundsof digestible nitrogen-
free extract sor each one thousand pounds of live weight. If more
nutrients than these are supplied, each one hundred grams of
digestible starch may cause a deposit oi 20 to 24 grams of iat in .
the body oi the ox.

tained by correspondence with a number of the leading dairymen
