searches ¹·do not furnish much information as to the quantity of
feed required for the performanoe of known amonnts of work, for
although graduated amcunts cf measured work were performed
by the horses under each diet, it was rare that the ration proved
exactly sufficient for maintaining the horses’ weight without gain
or loss Some points of importance were, however, clearly mede
out One of these is the effect oi pace on the amount of labor
exer-ted and the feed required therefor. Thus, a horse walking
1245 miles per day vas kept in condition with e daily ration oi
19.4 ponnds of hay, while one 0121000001 was insuffioicnt when
the same distance was covered nt a trot Again, chorso welkiug

the above distance and hauliug a load, the additional work being .

equivalent to 1,943 footfons, was sufficiently nourished by a
ration cf 2114 pounds oi hay, but one of 326 pounds (ull the
horse would eat) was not enough to maintain its weight when the
same work was done at a trot libat work is performed et least
eost lc the system when done slowly is a fact well recognized by
every old and feeble man, but the principle has not generally
been recognized as true in all cases

Some of the reasons why rapid labor is less economically per·
formed than slow labor are readily apparent When a horse is
trotting, the frequency of the pulse, and consequently the work
performed by the beart, is much increased. The trotting or gal·
loping horse lifts his own weight at each step, but allows it tc
fall again, the result appearing only as beat The temperatura
