rangements for controlling the work performed, are very conr-
plicated and nocd not be described here.¹ In the first series of
experimenta with the dyuamometer conducted during the summer
of 1877,’ 555 daily work performed by the horse during the five·
periodo of the experiment amounted to 3,429,500, 6,864,006,
10,288,560, 6, 859,060 and 3,429‚500 footpounds The ration fed
daily throughout the experiment was 13.2 ponnds 57 5555 11

pounds 57 555, 3.3 pounds of cut winter-wheat straw‚ 555 Α
555555 57 salt ’155 weight of the horse 5551,177 pounds

433. wirot was shown by 5115 1115555155 511515.- Digestion trials
55555555 during ω’ perron nowen enat no amount ot
work performed by the horse did not excrt any influenoe on
the digestibility 57 the ration fed The digestion eoefficients
found during thehve periodo were: for dry matter, 57, 56, 56, 54,
53 per cent3 for protem, 71, 68, 70, 67, 68 per cent3 for nitrogen·
neeextract, 68, 70, 68, 68, 64 percant, ete 'Phe somewhat lower
digestibility 57 the ration during the 1555 period 15 accounted for
by the 1555555551 the storing 57 the hay—the digestibility 57
555 decreasing with age 'Phe animai was never overworked
during the digestiou experiments‚ the hardest labor being easily
within its capacity. 'Phe heavier work 5555 during the third
period was accompanied by a greater quantity 57 water drank and
a decrease in 5551155 weight of the animal. ’155 results obtained
were corroborated in a second trial, when a highly nitrogenous
ration containing field beans was fed (16.5 pounds 57 555 555
88 ponnds 57 beans), and 5155 15 55111 later experimenta by the
came investigator.⁸ 'Phe results obtained by ¹Grraudeau and
1555155155 Frenoh 555 horsea (442) 55 555 quite correspond with
those found by Wolff with German farm horses, 55 given 55555,
555 former investigators finding 5515511 depressior in the digesti·
bility of rationu 755 to horsus doing slow work compared with
that obtained when restiug in the stall, and a somewhat larger
depression when doing harder work. 'Phe differentes obtained
were within three per cent 57 those found by Wolff, 555 are 555,
therefore, 57 much practical importunre.
