periments show that a horse ol average siae will do medium hard
work and maintain his weight on a ration containing about 12
pounds ol digestible matter. A nutritive ratio oi 1:o.4 proved
better than the narrow ration ot 123. When, aa in the later ex·
periments, 1000 thanat pounds oi digestible matter were supplied
in the ration, the weight of the horse recremanda deorease
being, under otherwise similar uenditions, more marked when a
narrow nutritive ratio (1:3.4) was led than when a wider ratio
(1106) was given. (445) When heavier work was done, a sup·

The digestible nutriente neeessary to maintain a horse 01 1,1oo
pounds in a medium nutritive condition, when not performing
any mechanieal work, was found in repeated experimento with
three horsea to be 9. 25 pounds on an average, when a eonsitler·

eoarse seed, via, manem hay. This proportion of ooarse seed
will hold good for sarm horsea doing an average day’s work in
rather slow time. Herses whieh are required to do heavy work

must have rations whieh are easily digested, and they should
