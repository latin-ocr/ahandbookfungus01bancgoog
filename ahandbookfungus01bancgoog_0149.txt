existing against the use of barley for stock feeding in this country,
some even asserting that it is poisonous to farm stoclr. Perhaps

we should understand their origin. In maldug, the grain is first
steeped in wooden or stone cisterna, where it remains until
sufficiently soft to be easily crnshed between the thumb aud
finger without yielding a milky Juiee The grains are next
spread upon a irame in a mass about twenty inches deep. Here

These three steps are all for the single purpose of eonverting
