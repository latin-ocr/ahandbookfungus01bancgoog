54.1te respic-atlon apparatae-A “respiration apparatum

isa device for measuring the products of respiration oi animals .

confined therela. its leading feature is an air-tight chamber in
which the animal experimented on is mannen, with an iulet for
supplying fresh air and an outlet for drawing off the air with its
respiration products. The air entering the chamber as well as
the gases drawn from it arc measured and analyred, to determine
the products given off hy the subject on trial. The most oom-
plete and satisfactory forins of the respiratiou apparatus are those
constructed according to the plau of Pettenkofer of the Physio·
logical Instituta at Mi'mich, the first of which was built through
the munificenoe of the King oi Bavaria There was recently
constructed at the Weslcyau University, (lonnectiout, hythe
co·opcration of the Stans (Oonnecticut) Experimcnt Station
and the United States Departmcnt oi Agricultura, Washington,
a very complete respiration apparatus especially designed for
the study of human nutrition’

In conducting experiments, animala or men, or both, are placed

in the respiration chamber. In some cases labor is performed
