furnished the ehoieest food grain for man. Wheat· has probably
never boen degraded to stook-foeding purposes until the most
recent times. During the last decade, owing to enormous pro
duction, the prices for this grain fell until they approaehed quite
oloso to those reoelved for corn. When this anomalous and dis
eouraging situation was reached, our sarmers at first hesitated‚
but with a sagacity most oreditable to them quiolrly overoame
their long-held and not unwarranted prejudioe against this seem·

so disposed of reaohed the enormous volume of 8500, 000 bushels
