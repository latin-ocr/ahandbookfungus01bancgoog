plied on tha organio substando oontained, instead of the dry
matter, as originally stated hy Lingenthai and Grouven. Agoin,
Wolff plaoes the allowanoe of organio matter required by the
dairy oow at 25 pounds; Riihn tellsusthis may vary between the
extremes of 20 and 33.5 pounds changes in the amount ol dry
matter supplied should, however, always be gradual. Kiihn fur·
ther protasis against prescribing exaot quantities of nutriente es
norms or standards “For the individual nutriente, as ior the
· total amount oi food, it is essential to determine the amount for
eaoh individual ease, and in doing this the particular eonditions

should be considered.’' Wolff does not distinguish between
digestible albuminoids and amidae, Kiihn holds that the lower
nutritive effeot oi amide oompounds oan no longer be doubted,
and thet these umidas ean at best serva only as albuminoid oon-

servers, like the oarbohydrates, and further that the non-albu-

minoid protein includes oompounds whioh do not even exart this
oonserving aetion and whose nutritive function is very doubtful.
Grouven fixed the total protein (digestible end indigestible)
for the dairy oow at 2.7 4 poundn while Wolff planas the mandard
at 25 of digestible albuminoids and amides. Kiihn states that
the oow of high productiva oapaoity during her largest fiow oi
ἱ milk requires Q than-235 pounds ol digestible protein, while
smaller amounts than Wolff names should be given with dimin·
ishing milk flow. Again, the ether extraot or so-oalled “iat”

· Kiihn lays stress on the importanoe oi individnal feeding, declar
