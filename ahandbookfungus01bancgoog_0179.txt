Morrow holds that, for Illinois eonditions, 10‚000 good stalks
81 8888 per aere (seeured by planting about 12‚000 kernels) give
the best returns in grain. 'Phe 188888 from the above table 18

by results in the 88888 1188 obtained at several other Stations The
great importanoe 81 1188 subject is sufficient excuse for 1188 space
