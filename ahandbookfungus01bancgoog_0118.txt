The nutritive 1011001 this rationis 1 : 125. The ration approx-
imates the standard as closely as 0011 110 attained without using

nor lose in weight-that is, such a combination eonstitutes a
“nrainteuanoe” ration.

nearly twioe as muoh carbohydrates as constitute 0 0101111οῃ0000
1011011, with the nutritive ratio narrowed to 1 : 6. 5. It is apparent
that more eonoentrated feed must enter into this ration than into
