led aro apparent upon a little reflection. In such places the
hay if long occupies too much space, litters up the building, and
the attendants are not readily able to supply each animal its
proper allowance. Where hay is chaffed, the addition ol a small
amount of water lays the dust, and the helper can rapidly and
accurately measure the quantity ordered lor each animal. These
