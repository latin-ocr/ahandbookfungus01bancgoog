blood in the bodies 01 these animala decreased somewhat on long
confinement in a dark room. The average quantity of blood in
the animals kept in the light was 220 grams, and of those kept
in a darkened room, 112 grains In another experiment, the
bodies of rabbits kept in light and dark rooms contained 100.3

’ grams and 90.6 grams 01 blood, respectively. Accordingtothese

experiments, darkening the stable will have a stimulating influ-
ence on the formation 01 fat in the bodies of animala (11011011-
berger also ascertained that the production 01 fat in animals kept
in 1110 light and those kept in the dark was as 100 : 126 101 the
first 16 days. After 46 days the ratio was as 100 : 119. With
full-grown animals the increase was as 100 z 216 after 24 days,
and as 100 : 138 01101 7 5 days

The deprivation 01 daylight, therefore, caused an increase in
the formation 01 fat and an increase in live weight. 'Phe increase
was larger in the caseos full-grown animals than with younger
ones3 and further, by prolonging the absence 01 light the increase
was relatively smaller than 101 the shorter time. As the develop-
ment 01 the skeleton and liver 01 the animal is retarded by dark-
ness, the prolonged absence of light has a deleterions effect upon
the health of the animal. While Graffenberger corroboratas the
results 01 1110100011011,ι 1101011,2 and other early investigators, that
light causes an increased excretion of oarbonie aoid and a greater
consumption of oxygen, he finds that protein consumption is not
influenced by the absence 01 presence 01 daylight
