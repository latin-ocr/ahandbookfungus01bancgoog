468. the 900100ωοί600 Oompany’s experimenta- Tho Paris
Omnibus Company, employing nearly ten thousand horses, began
feediug trials with Iudian coru in 1874.¹ Sixteeu horses 01 dif-
ferent ages having up 10 the time of the experiment been fed a
rat-ion consisting of 187 pounds of oats, 1.8 pouuds of bran, with
hay and straw additional, received, gradually, more and more oorn
iu thc place of cata until after one mouth the oats were replaced
by eoru. The barses weighed on an average 1194.1 pounds at
the beginning of the experiment, aud at the end, four months
later, 12198 pounds '.l'hey were in good flesh and had grown
fat, although they had worked hard during this time. It was
found, however, that they were less spirited and seemed to lose in
onergy when more than nine pouuds of oats wore replaced by
corn. 'Phe conclusione were that a mixture 0166 pounds of
corn and 101 pounds cf oats will prove most satisfactory for work
horses, the ratio varying in each case according to the tempera
ment of the animal. twenty-five other horses doing 'bus service
were fed 11 pounds oi oats and 6.6 pounds of corn, aiter a longer
transition period, with hay aud straw as before, aud after six
months equally favorable results were obtained. All horsea of the
company were fed in this manner during 1876 and afterwards

company did more werkin 1876 thau in 1875 on the oat ration.
