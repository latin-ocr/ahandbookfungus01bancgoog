tos. homoged obesa-When low prices prevail ior wheat,
only the best grades should be sold by the former. Shrnnken
and damaged grain has almost no market value at such times,
while tor teeding purposes it may be nearly or quita equal to
grain which commanda the highest price The former should
omefnlly grade his grain ethome and sell only the best

Sometimes the former with such whest on hand hesitates about
leading it, fearing disastrons resulta A number oi inquiries as
to the advisability of teeding poor wheat have come to the writer
in past years, and he hos always recommended that, instead ot
wasting such grain, it be fed in moderate quantities mixed with
other materiale No ill results have ever oome to notice from
such grain when fed in reasonable quantity. (ros—4)

comes the fourth, called the “aleurone layer,'' which is rich in
protein, and which during the process ol milling goes with the
three 01101 layers to form bran. Tho embryo or germ ottho
grain is rich in oil, proteiu and mineral matter. 'Phe remaining
portion ot the grain consiste of thiu-walled cells, all paoked to
repletion with starch grains Assooiated with the staruh are
grains of protein matter called gluten, which give to dough from
wheat flour that tenacity whioh enables it to retain gas bubbles,
produced by yeast fermentation, during baking‚ thereby yielding
a light, porous breed. In producing flour the aim of the milleris
to secure all of the starchand gluten possible, avoiding the other
constituente of the grain. He avoids incorporating the embryo
or germ because, though rich in oil and protelo, it turns dark on
exposure to the air and gives the dour a specked appearance3
further, the germ makes a stioky dough. Nor does the miller
desire tho alenrone layer, rich though it isin protein, ior flour
containing ithus a brown tint The amount ot gluten in the
wheat grain is smallest in the center and increases toward the
