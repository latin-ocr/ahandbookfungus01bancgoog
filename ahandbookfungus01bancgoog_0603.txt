These experiments in connection with those previously inade
show that the rations containing less than half the eonoentrates
in tho form 01 011 00100 were nearly ns effective asa pure grain
ration, and that increasing the quantity of oil cehe feel produoed
poorer results, the differenoe being greater when sirim millr was
fed than when feeding- whey. When rools were fed 10 both
rations the 011001 of the oil oake was still not so good, so lar as
gain in live weight goes, os in ease 01 pure grain feeding. These
results are of penuliar interest :sinoe the higher protein content of
the oil cakes would 0 priora· indicate a higher feeding value for
them than the oereals possess .In foeding trinis with 00000 01 the
