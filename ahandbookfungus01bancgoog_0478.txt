his herd. The true dairy oow is easily affected by unfavorable
conditione

Babeock of the Wieconsin Station,¹ aster carefm studies with
cows in many ways, writes: “ 'l'he elaborationes milk does not
proceed at a uniform rate from milking to milking, but is most
active at the time oi milking, aud is dependent not only upon the
stimulus which the milk glande derive hon the manipulation of
the teats aud udder, but upon the uervous condition of the animal
at the time of milking.

“ In consequence of this, slight changes in the conditione under
which the milking is done may have a decided influence upon
both the yield and quality ol milk Asa general rule the quality .
oi milk, measured hythe per cent of fat which it contains, is
more sensitiva to changes ot this kind thau is the yield ot milk.
Among the changes which appear to have most influance in th'ur
respect the following are of especial importando, via: change in
the interval between milkings and in the rate of milking; change
of milkers and manner ot milking, especially il the manipula·
tion of the teate and udder be different; change of enviroument
and any circumstance which excites or even slightly disturbs the
animal at the time— excitament between milkiugs, il the oow has
become quiet before milking, appears to have comparatively little
induence. As would be expected there is a great differeuoe in
cows in this respect some being very sensitiva, while others are
scarcely affected at all. Iu our experimenta cows that have been
giving milk for a long time have been less sensitiva in thisrespeot
than fresh oows that were giving a large quantity of milk, but
this may have been duo to individual characteristics of the
animala tested and not to the advanoed period of iactation. 1

· would recommend‚ therefore, in order to obtain the best results

from any eow, that first ol all she be treated kindly, all sources of
excitament being avoided so lar as possible. She should also be
fed und milked at regular intervals by the same person, and all
conditione should be maintained aa nearly uniform as possible at
all times. It is my opinion that kind treatment and pleamt

surroundings will have a greater influence upon the quality of
