salty acids. He fed a starved dog leau meat and a large quantity
of fatty aeids prepared from mutton suet. The animal, which
had shrunk 32 per cent. in weight during uiuet-een days, wasleri
3,200 grams of flesh and 2,850 grams of iatty acids in fourteen
days, and increased 17 per cent in weight during this period.
When killed, a well-developed layer of fat was found under the
skin, and also large deposits of fat on the internal organa By
use oi the knife, 1,100 grams of fat were separated, which
resembled mutton suet, and according to chemical analysis must
have contained at least 96 per cent. of neutral mutton suet It is
known that iatty acide are formed from the fat of the foed in the
digestiva proresses through the actiones the pancreatic juice,
and the above experiment therefore practically proves that the
iat stored in the body oi animale may be derived from the fat of
the foed Munk’s findings have recently been corroborated by
Walker, also in experimenta with dogs1

While experimenta like those quoted above cannot be made
with Herbivora, there is sufficient evidence to establish the fact
that the iat of the foed may, under favorable conditione, direetly
contribute to the body fat and milk iat oi animala. As will bc
seen later on, however, the iat in the animal body is not derived
from one component oi the foed only, but generally from both the
fat and carbohydrates, or possibly these two in conjunctior with
the proteiu of the sood, according to the conditione of feeding and
the relative amounts oi the different componente sed.

76. lat irem cerbobydretes.-Liebig maintained as early as
1842 that the fat of the Herbivora must be derived in a great
measure from the carbohydrates of the foed, but considered that
it might also be produced from its nitrogenous componente The
correctness of this view was questioned by leading scientists oi

that'time, although evidence in its favor was accumulating. In
1852 Lawes aud Gilbert published the results of their pig-feeding
experiments, showing that a large portiones the fat stored in
the body of a fattening pig must come from other sources than
the fatty matter of the iood. These investigators calculated the
