Iret us first study the wronsses oi the steere fed ior li months
Thnt oi the steer getting the protein-rioh ration contained more
then 3 per eent more water, the same amount of protein, end
neorly 2 per sent less iet then the other. This is in line with
other work in showing thet one oi the rosulis oi snoding much
protein to growing enimnls is o eereeffi containing more water.
For the steens eerried through 27 months oi snoding there is
praetioslly no differenoe in the oomposition oi the soree-sees

124. bohemien- Reviewing this experiment we sre led to eon-
elude thet retions rich in protein ere more eondneive to rnpid
growth and finer general eppeernnee oi the nnimnl when young,
than ratione rieh iu corbohydretes end rothen poor iu protein It
appears thet when ihe protem-poor ration eontnins enough nitro·
gen and seh to supply the actual demands of the body, the animal
eereiully eonserves them, being enabled thereby to iirlfill the lews
oi its neture es to growth. No doubt ii the steere getting the
least protein had been supplied with less protein end seh than
nature requires ior good body-building, they would plainly hove
shown it by an ebnormsl development; bnt, fortonetely, sooh eon-
ditions were not leid down in this experiment This experiment
endiis teeohings should be oompnred with the ieeding trinis with
pige by Senborn, the writer end others, reported in the first pert ¹
oi the chapter, where strongly one-sided ratione were fed
