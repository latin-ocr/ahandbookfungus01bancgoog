large area with a single speeies oi vegetation, and it is better to
humor her hy having several varieties of gram and clover in the .
same meadow or pastura than growing a single one, no matter how
valuable. For etock seeding at the North, a mixture of rontop,
timothy and orchard grass with one or two kinds of clover will
give a larger yield oi aromatis, palateble hay than is possible
with a single variety. There are several other varieties oi grasses
which will thrive in special locations 'Phe stookman should
experiment ireely with the more promising varieties, that he may
learn by direct experiment which combinatione are best suited to

grasses, consistes many races and varieties mixed in hopeless
confusion German millet and Hungarian grass are the millets
commonly grown in the Northeru states Sown in early summer,
they thrive remarkably in bot and even dry westher, reaching
the harvest period in August or September. In order to produce
hay oi fine quality, a liberal allowance of seed should be sovn.
With thin seeding millet stema are coarse end need-like, forming
a hay of low quality. All forms of millet grass designed ior
hay should be out just cs the plant is coming into blossom to
avoid the formationes hard seeds which are indigestible by
horses and cattle. Hay from thicklyseeded millet, ii cut early,
is useful ior cattle and sheep seeding. Is given ¹to horsea, it
should be fed very sparingly und under close supervision„ (198)

At the Massachusetts Station‚² Brooks, experimenting with
J apanese millet, grew orops in which the planta reached a height
os six feet, yielding from twelve to eighteen tons of green forage
peracre. Millet forage was much relished by dairy cows, prov-
ing superior to flint corn fodder.
