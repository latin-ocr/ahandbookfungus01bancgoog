total albuminoid nitrogen up to the maturity oi the plant, the
amide nitrogen varied greatly at different periods, being less

Ooncerning these changes Ladd says: “The total starch per
acre increased more than twenty-three times between, tasseling of
corn and harvesting, a periodos fifty-live days From the stage
of glazing oi corn until iull ripening the increase in dry matter
was 716 pounds, the increase in nitrogen-free extract 587 pounda
while the increase of sugar and starch was 989 pounds, or‘grester
by 273 pounds than the entire gain in crop. Thotis, much of the
nitrogendree extract, which at period of glazing of corn wesin
the transitory state, had been translocated and transformed into
sugars and starch.” “

Jordan, of the Maine Station,¹ studying thesarne subJect writes:
“ Owing to the relatively large production of sugars and starch
in the late stages of growth, apound of the dly substance of the
mature well-enred corn plant possessos a higher nutritive value
than at any earlier stage of growth.'’ Compare with develop-
