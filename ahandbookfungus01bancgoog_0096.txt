loe. what the tehles show.- The first table shows that in every
inetenoe the proten-rien ration pmduoed heavier gains than the
others In the several columns are given the veights oi various
parts and organs of the body. Sinee pigs sed on the several
rations reaehed different weights at the time of daughter, the

weights are reuuoed to a eommon standard for eomparison, This
is done in the second table, where the veights of the different
perte are stated ior eaeh 100 ponnde of dressed eareaes

It is seen in the second table that the pigs fed the protem-rich
rations usually show alnrger shrinkage than those getting oorn
meai. This is aooounted sor in part by the larger amount of
blood, heavier livere and other organs of the protein-fed pigs

Iu nearly every instanoe the pigs reoeiving the pmtein-rieh
ratione yielded more blood than those led eorn. In the Kansas
trial the pigs getting shorts aud bran had 512 ounees of blood to
100 puunde of earnem, while the eoru-fed pigs had only 36.8
ounoes In Fortiers trials in Franee, the blood of the corn-meal-
ted pigs vas less than half that of the pigs reoeiving the protein·
rioh ration, the ratio standing 55.1 to ael. The only exception
vas in the Wiseonsin trial, where the pigs were made very fat
by feeding milk.

In every instance the pigs fed the protein-rioh ratione had
heavier livere thau the others, the differenoe osten being very
marked. For example, in the Missonri trial the pigs fed mid·
dlings had livere weighing 48.4 ouneesto 100 pounds oi eauoess,
while those ol the lot fed corn weighed only 31.9.

Generally, the kidneys of the protein-fed pigs are heoviest,
though in Fortier²s trials the reverse oeours

'Phe tenderloin musoles lying along the back 01* the pig are
easily disseeted from the remainder oi the oeream, and in oue
trial in Wiseonsiu and in the Kansas trial these museles were
separated and weighed. Iu both cases the museles of the pigs
getting the protein-rieh rations were heavier in proportiou to the
weight of the body than those ol the pigs fed corin] This is proof
of more lean meat in the oaroasses of pigs fed the most protein.

The pigs getting corn meal gave more leaf laud than the others,
exeepting in the Frenoh trial, where the results uere praetieally
