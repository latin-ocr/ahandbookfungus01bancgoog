losses must oeour through washing by rains and wasting of the

losses ooaur in shoek oorn than is possible from this eause alone.

At the Wiseonsin Station, Woll¹ determined the dry matter

ll'e are told of a loss of nearly one-fourth of dry matter and
protein whielr the erop contained at harvest time by preserving
(orn sorage in the usual manner. This seems incredible, but the
subject has been studied by too many Stations with unanimity of
results to admit of further question. Ooolre² has shown that
lreavy losses oeeur in shoek corn in the dry elimate of Colorado.
The substanees lost through wasting are protein and nitrogen-free
extmet (edgar, staroh, eta), the more valuable portions of the
forage. Nor is it possible to entirely prevent these losses by
placing the eured sodder under shelter or iu the staek, ior it has
been found that the toroge continues to waste even under these
frivorable eonditions

At this lime we are unable to state through what instrumen-
tality all these losses are brought about. Some substance isweshed
away by rain, and the wiuds carry off exposed leaves and parus
