18. Aah- Having determined the water in the cample, the

chemist next burns it to uscertuin 118 ash content caro is
taken that no 0118100111 18 leh, only the clear ash remaining. 'l'he
next column shows the percenfage of ash in the feeding stuffs
under consideration. In 100 pounds 01 pastum grass there are
25 pounds of ash. Indian corn has only 1.5 pounds of ash for
100 of grain, while red clover hay yields 6.2 pounds This large
amount eomes in part hom tho accumulatior of ash in the leaves
of the clover plant, and in some measure is ducto earth washed
up on 1110 stems of the plant by rein, and to the dost which set·
tles on planis and on hay before it is placed in the barn. Such
foreign maferial is really not auh, but of‘necemity is reported m
such.

19. Proteia-The process of determining the profein in a
feeding stuff is too eomplicatcd 101 presentatiou here. Suffioe it 10
say chat the nitrogen contained lherein 18 determined, aud that
the sum 8ο secured 18 multiplied by 615 10 determine the 01010111,
since 11 has boen found that about 16 per oenc of protein sub·
stances consish of nitrogen. By the table we find that the protein
of pastore grass amounts to 4, mangels t01.4‚eorn 101113, and
red clover hay to 123 pounds per hundred weighh We are
shown that passae grass is much richer in protein than arc
mangels, and that clover hay is likewise richer than the grain of
the corn plant.
