potassium, saluium, magnesiam, phosphorus, iren, uhlorin and
sulfur. The plant ean make no use of these elementa in their
uneembined form, with the single exeeption oi exygen, of whioh
it may utilize a small amount in elementary form. All the other
elementa as well us oxygen ior the most part, must be combined
with one another in some form to be of use to the plant 'she
mineral substances which are taken up by the roots os the plaut
may be grouped us follows:

Suillates Potassium
Phosphates Catulum
Nitrates and οἱ Magnesiam and
Chlorids Iron.

Nitrogen in the form of nitrates and as ammonia is taken up
by the plant through its route legumes (pens, clover, ete)
possess the power os fixing the free nitrogen of the air through

. the intermediate aetion of certain speeies of buoteria harbured

by the roots Otherwise sueh 'nitrogen is not direotly availahle
for plant growth.

3. water required hy plenta— Wuter, as we may judge from
its abundauee in planta, is of the highest importunae to them.
Half-grown clover plaute may oontain us mueh us 92 per eent
water, or more than is found in skim millu 'Phe turnip euntains
from 87 to 92 per cent. water. When a orop ot eoru ispa1tially
grown, nine-tenths of its whole weight may be water. Plauts ’
exhele a large amount os water through their leaves during
growth. A suntlower plant 3.3 feet high has been known to
exhalo 125 pounds of water through its leaves during twelve
houm laves and Gilbert found in the moist elimate os England,
that wheat, barley, beans, peas and olover exhaled during five
months os growth about 200 timestheirdryweightof water. King,
of the Wisaousin Stat=ion‚¹ measuring the water given off through
leaf evaporation as well as by the soil supporting the planta,
found that for eaeh pound os dry matter produoed by the plant
in root, stem, leat and seed, there were required for oorn 301,
ior berley 401, audior oats 501 pounds of water. The transpi-
rationes water by the leaves causes au upward progress of that

liquid from the roots through the stem of at least 1.3 inuhes
