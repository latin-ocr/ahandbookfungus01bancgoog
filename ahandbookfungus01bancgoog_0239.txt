iaed in the following:² “In conclusion, the evidence ο1 direct
experiment clearly goes to show that all but identical amounta of
the dry substance ot cane sugar and ol starch are both consumod
hy a given weight ο1 animal withina given time, and are required
to yicld a given weight os increase. 'rue practical identity in
leading-valae, which from the known chemioal relationship ot
these two substances has hitherto been assumed, is now therefore
experimentally illustrated, and it probably only varies in point
oi fact with their slightly varying percontages oi carbon.” ‘
