398. When to use Southoeo eom ior clope- From the table it
appears that we are assured of larger returns ol total dry and
digestible matter at the North hythe use oi large southern varie·
ties oi corn. Seuthem corn should not be grown ior either silo
or forage purposes, however, unless the climatlc conditione per·
mittheearsto develop grains oi corn which reaeh theglazing stage
at time oi harvest This variety of corn will prove a favorite for
both silagc and dry forage where thero is an urgent demand sor
the largest possible amount oi coarse, palatable forage from a
given acreage. By the use of Seuthem varieties of seed corn at
the North the stookman can provide an enormous quantity oi
ronghage from a given area

On the other hand the stocknran who has a sair supply oi hay,
straw or stover at command will fill his silo with a richer seed-
ing stuli than that produced by Seuthem corn, and for this pnr-
pose will use varieties oi ilint or dent corn which will fully
mature in his locality, planting the crop in such manner as to
secure a relatively large proportior oi grain to roughage. Silage
made from the smaller varieties ol corn, carrying a considerable
proportior of ears, will prove erich ieeding stuli which will
materially reduce t-he necessity for additional grain Oomsilage,
which is rich in carbohydrates, should be supplemented by clover
hay, if possible, not only because some dry food is required, but
became this hay is rich in protein.
⁴ 399. space occupied by silspe eod dry todeca-A cubic foot of
hay in the mow weighs about five pounds According to King¹
a cubic iootof corn silage in athirty·ioot silo weighs 30.6 pounds
Estimating that hay contains 13.2 per cent and silagc llll per
cent of water, we have the following:

One oublo foot ol hay ln the mow contains 134 lbu dry matter.
. One cubic loct oi sllnge ln e thirty-foci silo contains 828 lbs. dry matter.

We leam that a given volume of silage contains nearly twice as
much dry matter as the same volume oi hay stored in the nrow.
