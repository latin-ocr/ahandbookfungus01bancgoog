grains 01 fat. 'Phe total quantity 01 101 in the food amounted to
19 granis, so that if this was digested and deposited in the body,
342 grains of fat must have been formed from other sources The
nitrogen excreted as urea showed a decomposition 01 65.4 granis
of protein in the body of the animal. This quantity of protein
could at best form nc more than 65.4 x .514, (78) 01 386 grams
01 101, leaving 308.4 grams 01 101 deposited in tbe body to be
derived from carbohydrates Seven to eight times as much fat,
therefore, originated from this source as could have been formed
from the protein and the fat in the food.

Allowing 114 per cent. for impurities, Collier says there is still
