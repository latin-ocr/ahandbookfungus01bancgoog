884. lile worll ot [jord end frte-since the year 1880 alarge
number oi pig-feeding experimenta bave been conducted by th'e
Danish Experiment Station at Copenbagcn, under the direction
-of the late Professor J. N. Fjord and his successor, Il. Friis
These experimenta are exceedingly valuable because of the vari-
ety of conditione under which they were conducted, the large
number of animale included, and the care bestowed on the details
of the work.

The feeding was conducted on the cooperative plan on a nurn-

ber ol Danisb estates, or large larms, under the direct supervie·
ion of the officials of the Stat-ion, who planned the experiments,
made the weighings, sampled and analyzed the leeds and con·
ducted the slanghtering teste In these trials the pige were
divided into selected even lots conrposed of five to ten animale
each, the different lots being so fed as to express the comparative
value of the feeds under examination. In a majority of cases

the obJect in view was the relative seeding value of different
swine foods under good sarm conditione Incidentally a number
ol other problema were included, such as the value of shel-
ter, the influence of water on sattening, breed experimenta ques-
tion of sex in sattening, intluence of season on sattening, etc.
The results ol these experimenta have been published in the
periodical reporta (Beretninger) of the station, ol which thirty-
nine bave appeared to date.

The Danish pound equale 1.1 pounds avoirdupois As the
results stated are nearly always relative, they are given in Danish
pounds, astbey appear in the original reporta ‘Wherever avoir·
