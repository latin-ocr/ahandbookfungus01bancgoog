611. induente ol succulent laed-It is commonly asserted that
succulent foed causes thinner milk, i. e, renders it more watery.
Schmoeger,¹ at tho Proskau Dairy Instituta, showed that feeding
30 litere (quarta) of distillcry slop daily per head to a herd oi
37 cows did not affeot the composition ol milk, the average solids
being 11.83 per cent and iat 3.29 per cent with the slop feeding
as against 11.61 percont and 3. 28 per cent, respectivcly, during
tho previous period. Δ

Trials by Armsby, feeding green aud dried grassto milch cows,
showed no change in the composition of the milk because of the
more succulent grass (265) In the Danish experimento, where
roots were led, the highest per cent of solids appeared in the milk

ol cows receiving the largest quantity of roots (W)

There was a slightly higher fat content with cows on pasture in
all cases

At the Vermont Station,⁸ Hills, stndying the change in com·
position of milk ol cows changed from barn to pastore during
five years, concludes: “ The evidence appears overwhelming that
cows on early pasturage- May and J une—make not only more,
but richer, milk than during the last months ol their barn lile.''
In these cases the higher lat content is always accompanied by a
