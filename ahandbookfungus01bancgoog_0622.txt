small and hard, wheat should always be reduced to mccl before it

ers As we have seen, (852) wheat and corn meal in combine
tion give better gains than either separately.

development, middlings stand pru-eminent Because it con-

tains, much protein and ash aud is not loaded with crudeiiber
like bran, this feoding staff is particularly suited to the nourish·
ment of very young pige, ranking next to the by·products of the
dairy for that purpose (101) Middlings serveadmirably with
corn ior feeding pigs during the fattening period. Like other
milling try-products, middlings are said to produce soit pork, and
therefore should never be ied alone, bnt always with oorn, harley
or other grains

and mineral mat-ter, but its iibrous, chatiy character rendere it
unfit for the digestiva apparatus of the young pig, which hes hut
a limited capacity. (896) Middlings rather than bran should be
fed to young pige, bnt as they increase in siae some bran may
be fed with advantage, especially where it is desirahle to add
volume to the ἰωὰ. Bran may be fed with good mults to breed·
ing stock and to a limite‘d extent to fahening swina, the amount
ln the latter case heing restricted, lest the volume of the feed
he too much increased. Harris¹ recommends thet bran be sup·
plied to pige in a separate trough, where they can eat it at will.

leads the cereale in the quality of porlr produced. (894) In
quantity of product returned from feeding a given weight of
grain it yields to eom. (857. 894) Becarise consumere are grow-
