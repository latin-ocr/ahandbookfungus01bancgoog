stantly reinforced with nutriment At the seme time it io taking
up the waste matter of tho body whioh must be mmoved. This
is uoeomplished in part by the lungo, into which the blood is

While in the lungo, the blood takes up oxygen tium the inspired

The expired uir therefore contains from 4 tob per oent less
oxygen and that much more carbonio aoid thau the inspired air.
Consideruble moisture also esuapes with the expired air, and a
small amount of other products in the form of orgauio matter.
The amount of watery vapor given off by a mun is obtimated at
1.5 pounds per day.
