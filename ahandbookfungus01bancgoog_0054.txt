sole source of nitrogenous substanoes in the body, it follows that
the formation oi flesh is primarily dependent upon the supply of
protein in the food.

In the body there is a slow but continuone breaking down of
tissue. 'l'he materiale which have been dissolved imm the iood
in the process oi digestion are absorbed by the blood, and through
it distributed to the different paruos the body, where they are
either oxidized (consumed), and hcet and encrgy produced, car· ·

decomposition of nutritive material in the blood, and of muscular
and other body tissuos, goes ou continuously as long as the animal
lives, whether it is awake or aslecp3 being, however, more active
in the former condition. 'Phe term “protein consumption” as
used in this book is applied to the quantity oi nitrogenous
materiale decomposcd in the animal body, whether originating
from musculas tisana or nitrogcnous nutriente in solution in the

amount oi nitrogen found in the uriae, since practically all the
nitrogen which leaves the body passos off through this excre-
tion. (57)
