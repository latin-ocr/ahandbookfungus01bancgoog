the grain. No one eun stndy the Western situation without bo
eoming impremed with the belief thet the better cluss of these
feeders ere, efter eil, about right in this preotioe Corn is never
so eeeeptnble to e steer us when unhusked 'rbere is e iueshness
and peletebility about en eer of eoru wropt in Nature’s novering
which every steer recognizes end shows by the eegerneoe with
which he consumes it

Feeding shook eoru is n sannaebry pruotiee iu many insiunees,
ior the orop is then handled with the ieest lubor. '1¹he fodder
with its weulth ol ears is thrown into long feed rocks standing in
an open lot or undere ebed, the steens doing the busking end
grinding. Some fodder is oeten, and the woste eors end grains
ore eugerly pinked up by shotes running with the steens

Snnpped eoru, i. e, ears severed hom the stulks but still wropt
in the husks, is sueeessiully used for steen ieeding. Husked esr
oorn is extensively ied, though the grains ere not so fresh us iu
the two forms named above end ere not ulweys so eeeepteble
&oense of another condition, vin, hsrdness oi the grains (torn
in the erib exposed te the dry uir of the West osten herema very
hurd end the grains injure the mouth oi the steer in the prooess
of mastication. 'Po avoid this diffioulty the eers ere ohopped or
broken into pieres or fed efter making. Soeking does not render
the gruis more digestible, but enables the steer te orush it with
more ease and oiten to eousume a lerger quantity.

Trials at tbe Stations show thet eoru meel gives lamet gains
with steens then the some weight of unground grsin. Itis prob
oble uiso thet meel permits ol* o higher finish with neers then
unground eorn. Preotioel experienee und studies by the suttona
show thet pigs following steers fed oorn meel get very little frum
the droppings3 not beeeuse such droppings ore without nutri·
ment, but rather because the meel in the droppings isin e form
whieh cannot bo utilized by the pig.

Reviewing the subject from the stendpoint oi experiment and
practice, the writer is of the opinion thet where eoru is obern) the
