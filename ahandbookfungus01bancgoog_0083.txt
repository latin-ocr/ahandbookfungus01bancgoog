employruent ol its power in doing the sarno pieoe of work3 with
the same individual the quality and intensity ol thework produces
great differences, and further researches are required to reduce
the variatione in question by regular use to an individual and
perhaps a typical average value.”

97. The sources ot musculsr ecergy.- wolff further says:1
“ The essential sources of muscular power are seen in the decom·
position prodesses in the body, l. e, in the destruction which
portioris of the body or the food resorbed from the digestire treet
undergo by the passage ot the plasma through the tissnea 'lo
this end, as we have already seen in the case ot fat-production,
both nitrogenous and non-nitrogenous substantes contribule. As
these materiale are resolverl by the intluence ol orygen into
simple groaps of atoms, the energy of chemical soree which
previously linked the etorns together in more complicated group·
ings is set at liberty, and cau be employed as kinetic energy lor
the externel work of the body. In a conditiones rest, this energy
serves for the internal work of the organs or is converted into
electric current, etc. The animal body otten stores up a certain
amount ol energy3 as soon as this storo has been rapidly exhausted
by work, a period of rest is necessary to enable fresh material to
tlow through the fissae-cells and generate fresh energy tor the
production of more active¹ work. The force-productior and all
phonomena resulting from the combustiones organie matter in
the animal body mustobey thelawos the corrservation ofenergy.”
1 98. (ἴοιιάυοίοη.- 'l'alring the experiments here presented and
many others by the investigators tor guidance, we may conclude
that in the exercise of force there is greatly increased expenditure
of the non-nitrogenous constituente ot the food (carbohydrates
and ether· extract), and but little ol the nitrogenous. (440) At
the earne time the importante of niuogenous sood must not be
under-estimated, for, as Wolff tells us: “No one expects much
work from meu or animala sed on a diet poor in nitrogen, such as
potatoes and rice. Parnon of body is never considered a sign of
muscrrler strength.”
