Sebolien² calls attention to similar changes in the composition
oi milk produced by Norweglan cows while on mountain postam
as compared with that produced in the vallcys.

conclusione are not uniform in this particular, as shown by the
dndings of Iawes and Gilhert,¹ who write: “The yield of milk
was, however, in a much grooten degree mereascd by grazing
than by any other change in the iood3 and with ns, at any rate,
the inflnonce of roots comes next in order to that oi grass,

ably redueed3 though, owing to tho greatly increased quantity
yielded, the amount of constituente removed in the milk whilst
graaing may, newertheless, be greater per head per day than
under any other conditione”

With such confliot of opinion may wo not agree with Sebelien,
who suggests that the general feeling of well-being, the inlinenoe
of sunlight, the pleasant spring westher and an ontdoor life have
more to do with the change produced, whether the iat is increased
or deoreased percentagely, than does the change in feed itnelt
