dmws the following conclusione from investigations conducted by
himself aud others conceruing the walue of Indinn oorn as a tood
for homes: “ Corn is well adopted to replebo ocis, since tho
chemioal composition of both cemnls, especially as regmdsprotoln
and int, are nearly thesemo 'l'he whole grain seed may bo mado
up of corn in winter time and three-fourths of it in summer tima
Five poundsof corn are equivnlont to six pounds of osta 'l'he
heawiest foed should bo given at night The change from oats to
corn foed should occur very gradually, the transition period last·
ing from two to four weeks according to the extent to which the
oats are to ho fed in connection with tho corn. Now corn should
not be iod to horses The American dent varieties of corn are thc
best adopted tc horse feeding.”

oi the Maius Station,¹ conducted fecding experimenta with colts
in which oats were fed against a mixture oi other concontratcs,
such aa pcas and wheat middlings, in the mot trial, and gluten
moal, linseed moal and middlings in the second trial. In the first
trial, which lasted 137 days, oats when fed to three gnada Per·
cheron oolts‚ 9, 16 and 18 months old, produced less growth than an
equnl weight cf a mixture of pecs and middliugs, the relation of
growth made being as100 2111. In the second trial, two Per-
oheron colta both 11 months old, were fed oats against middlings
gluten meal and linseed moal, in tho proportion oi 60 ε 35 ε lb.
