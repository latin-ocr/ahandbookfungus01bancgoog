At first thought it appears impossible that us good gains ean be
secured with young pigs from a given amount of foed administered
through the sou as ean be obtained by direot ieeding. A pos
sible explanation lies in the faot that the body oi the very young
pig oontuins a large proportion oi vater, so that less dry matter
is required for a pound of gain than with older animale Again,
eaoh pound oi flesh lost by the dam during this time may have
yielded more than a pound oi inorease with her young.
