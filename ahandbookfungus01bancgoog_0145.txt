corn in any form. Fed with this grain it gives bulk, supplies

oi over-ieeding. Thougb a horse or cow may be gorged with

an over-seed of coru or cotton-seed moal may produce fatal

As a complementary food to corn meal, the combinationes bran

and that grain is not to be excelled. For young pigs bran is too
course aud strawlike, (896) aud middlings should be substituted

ior it For brood sows aud older animala some bran may be fed
with profit, and may prove very uselul if the rumaiuder of the
ration is iu coucentrated form, lor volume is necemary with the
seed of such animala This loy-produco is also very satisfactory
in the sheep yard, being relished by fatteuing sheep, breeding
ewes and growing lamba (463. 544, 640-42, 762. 855)

wheat grain is somewhat richer iu uitrogen and mineral matter
thau coru. 'rho hyproducts of wheat iu milliug are much richer
iu these particulare thau the grain from which they are derived.
Highgrade tlour is not rich in nitrogen or mineral matter. Low-
grade flour is rich in nitrogeu but low in mineral matter. Dark
iecding flour is rich iu uitrogeu and mineral mutter. Bran and
shorts carry all the elementa of fertility iu large quantity, audior
this reason aru highly appreciated by those foedera whose interest
mohac beyond their cattle to the lauds they till. (414) When
very low in price, bran'may be used as a fertiliaer by direct
application to the land, but such perversiou should not be toler-
aaa It should be first fed to auimals and, through their drop
piugs, it will resch the land almost audiminished in terulity.
