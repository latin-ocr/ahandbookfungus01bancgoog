The rations were as follows:

Drled Brewers’ Graius Ration. OatRatlon.

Corn, unground ............... 4 Corn, unground ................ 4
Drled brewers’ malus ...... 8 Qats. ................................ 8

Eaeh ration was fed to a group of four horses ior a month, then
the two feeds reversed ior a second mouth. Thou followed a
period in which tho stable ration prevailed with both lots, the
trial olosing with a month's feeding oi tho two ratious to the
original lom, as iu the first instance. The veterinarian in charge
oi thehorsesreports: “Ihave watched the horses closely from the
beginning to the end of the experiment aud have failed to dis·
oover any ill effeets from the uss of dried brewers’ graius The
horses fed the grains have been as healthy as I have ever known
them to be.” 'Phe conclusione of the Station authorities wore:
“ That in both rations the nutriente furnished were sufficient to
maintaiu the weight oi the auimals under average work‚'’ and
“ 'l'hat on the whole, apound of dried brewers' grains was quite
as useful as a pound of oats in a ration for work horses.” It was
found thet the oet ration eost, at preveiling prices, 24.3 cents per
day, while the ration containing brewcrs’ grains eost 19.4 cents,
a differenoe of 4.9 cents per day per horse, or twenty per cent of
the eost oi the oat ration-an insignificant amount perhaps fora
single horse, but making an aggregate oi great importando ior
large establishments

According to Wolff,1 “The effect of dried brewers' grains
has been found to be uncertain, and on that account their use
has been abandoned hythe German war department.’' While
brewers’ grains dried by any open-air process may be subject to
miliciam, the charge cannot stand for grains which are dried
rapidly in pertial vacuum. (183)
