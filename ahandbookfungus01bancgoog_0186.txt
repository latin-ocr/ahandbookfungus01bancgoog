In view of these facts, when calculating the valne of a erop of
corn forage, a deduction should be made from its worth at harvest
time for its reduced value at feeding time, if 'the latter occurs
some mouths after harvest.

247. [oddar com for salinae Feeding corn in the green stage
should become a general practice upon most farma, for the reason
that, during the fall, pasturas are often scanty, and if forced to
subsist entirely upon them animala cannot do their best It will

may so advanee the condition of steers dairy oows or other stook
as to yield a double value over what it would if saved until winter
and fed out at a time when there is often a plethora of the same
material.
