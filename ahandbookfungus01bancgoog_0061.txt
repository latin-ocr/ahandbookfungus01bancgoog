'Phe above experimenta were not all oondueted with th same
animala and therefore cannot be saiely compared h one
another. We notice, however, that supplying a small amount 01
protein with a large amount 01 earhohydrates, as in Experiment
6, gives a poor gain 01 protein and also a low peroentage gain 01
protein digested in the iood3 a medium quantity 01 protein with
a liberal supply 01 earbohydrates 00 given in the first group ot
experimenta canses a greater consumption 01 protein in the body,
and a larger pereentnge 01 digested protein. When we 00000 to
the last gloup 01 experimenta, where the digestible oarbohydrates
0000111010 from 4.9 to 22 times the quantity 01 protein present,
we again obtain poor results, there being a large waste 01 protein
in the body, aud 0 small gain, both relatively and absolutely, tor
the total protein supplied. Oomparing Experiments3 and 9, itwe
may seiely do so, we observe that the same gain 01 protein to the
body 01 the animal was obtained in one oase from alittle more than
one-third 01 the quantity 01 digestihle protein that was fed in the
other ense. At the same time the consumption 01 protein was
more than three times as large in the latter ease as in the former.
