The second column of the table shows that eight ieeding triala
have been made with corn stover to determine the digestibllity oi
its several componente Sixty per cent of the dry matter, 45 ottho
protein, 67 of the crude fiber, 61 of the nitrogen-free extract, and
62 per cent of the ether extract are, on the average, digested
from this iodder hy the fluidsof the alimentary tract and absorbed
by the animal body. In statements oi this character, the aver-
age of a large number oi determinatione is more satisfactory and
rcliable than the data oia single trial.

'lable A shows that oat straw contains more protein than corn
stover. Table B shows that tepor centos the protein in corn
stover, and only 30 per cent ol that in oat straw, are digestible
It shows that the nutriente in the concontrates are more digestible
than those in ronghage, crude fiber exeepted. For example,
'18 per cent of the protein in the cat grain, and only 30 per cent
of that in oatstrav, are digestible. In corn stover 61 per cent of
the nitrogen-rree extractis digestible, and in the corn grain 93
per oent. It thus appears that a given quantity of total nutriente
in concontrated ieeding stnffs is usually more valuable than the
same amount in coarse forage.

ior each nutrient in this table is determined by multiplying its
composition, as given in Table A, by the iactor ol digestibility in
'lable B.
