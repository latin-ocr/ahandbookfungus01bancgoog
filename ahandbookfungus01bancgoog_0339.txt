506. Pteparetioo ol leed- The food requircments oi the horse
vary more than for any other farm animal because ol their wide
. range iu weight and the great diversity and severity of the labor
performed. Idle horsea may be maintained wholly or almost
wholly upon hay, straw or corn fodder, led uncut Such animals
have ample time ior masticating tood, and their systema not being
taxed by labor, they are ableto subsint on lood which coumins a
large percenlage of inert matter. Forage possessing considerable
volume, as hay and straw, is suitable ior such animals because a
reasonable amount will inruish the necessary nutriment, and itia
better to have the digestiva tract well distended with food sub
stancoe than wntracted, as would be the case ii concentmtes pos·
sessiug only the requisita nutriment were supplied.

For horsea taxed to the limit of their endurance all grain
should be ground and fed upon moistened, chaffed hay. Food
thus prepared is more rapidly masticated and consequently re
mains a longer time in the stomach. A little long hay may be
supplied the animal, to be consumed at leisure astarthe stomachis
well filled. Understanding the requirements oi animala repre
senting the two extremes, one can adjnst the iood preparation and
supply to meet the various intermediate arses as they arisc.

Ι There is always moro or less dust with hay, and this rougb-
