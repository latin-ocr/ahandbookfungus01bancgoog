oi force is duc to the breaking-down oi ioan-meat [issue in the
animal body, aa is shown by the following21

“The amount oi aaotized food (protein) necessary to restore
the equilibrium between waste and supply is directly propor-
tional to the amount oi uacuos metamorphoaed.

“The amount of living matter, which in tho body locas the
condition oi liic, is, in equal temperaturas, directly proportione!
to the mechanicul effectu produced iu a given time.

“ The amount oi tissuc metamorphosed in a given time may be
measurod by tlte quantity oi nitrogen in tho urina.

“ 'Phe sum oi the mechanical effecto produced in two individuale
in the sama temperatura ia proportional to the amount oi nitrogen
in their urine3 whether the mechanical force hasbeen employed
involuntary or involuntary motione, whether ithaabcen consumed
by limbs or by the heart aud other vincera”

thoy conducted the following experimentzl Two pigo of similar
waight and appearance were delected 'lo one was given all
it would consume oi lentii meal, a seed rich in protein, containing
about 4 per cent. of nitrogen. The other pig was fed all it would
consume of barley moal, containing leus thani percont oi nitro--
