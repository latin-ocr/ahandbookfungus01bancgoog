composition os Animal Bady. 77

As a natural result of the larger consumption of food, the pig
increases in weight more rapidly than the sheep or ox. Not only
is the rate of increase more rapid, but the increase yielded by the
pig is also iar greater in proportior to the food consumed, as
plainly appears irorn the lower division of the table. 'Phe pig,
with its very large consumption of foed, has, 111 fact, tospend a
smaller proportion of it on heat and work, and has a larger sur-
plus to storo as increase. Of 100 pounds digested organic
matter, the iattening ox spends about 77 for heat and work, the

sheep 74, and 1111 pig 57. The upper division of the table shows, ·

however, that in a given time a pig converte a much larger
amount of food into beat and work than either the sheep or ox.
This greater consumption probably represents the interna] work
performed in laying·on increase. 'Phe pig, with its rapid ieeding
and high rate oiincrease, isundoubtedly the most economioal meat
making machine at the sarmer’s disposal. The returns of sheep
lie between those given by oxen and pigs, being, however, much
nearer the former than the latter. The German experimenta
place the sheep below the ox as an economio producer of increase,
instead of above it, as in the Rotharnsted stetistios just quoted.
'Phe differenoo is probably due to the different breeds of animale
