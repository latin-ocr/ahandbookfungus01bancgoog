noted from the protein may be deposited as body fat. Ι1 the

differently from fat fed in conjunction with protein, since the

Voit’s position, that even the largest quantities 01 carbohydrates
sed in connection with protein are decomposed in the animal
body, 10 held antenable by Pfliiger,¹ who maintains that 11 011
