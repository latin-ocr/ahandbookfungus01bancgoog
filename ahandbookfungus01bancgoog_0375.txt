practice of weighing the stom for three suecemive days and taking
the average of these three weights us the true weight oithe steer on

558. What Soutlrero §tatione have found- For generations the
effort of the South has been toward cotton productiori, which du·
mands scrupulously clean culture Until recently grass has been
a despised plant but it is now overrunning many ottho old
plantations, and while restoring the soil to something like its

former fertility and elothing the gashed fields with a carpet of

green, it is giving good returns in nutritious food to the cattle
grazing upon it Many a worn-out cotton plantation can be made
to yield in Bormuda grass, Johnson gram, J apen clover, corn,
sorghum and other planta, an amount of seed that would surprise
Northern stockmen.

559. Cotton seed ior teci deductione· Equally important with
the growth of grass is the enormous productiones cotton seed,
which furnishos a most valuable seed ior cattle Cotton seed,
either raw, boiled or rousted, inruishes a nutritione iood forcatus,
while moal from the seed is the richest stock iood produced in
this country. The hulls oi the cotton seed have been iound te

of their abundance and avallability they constitute a factor of

Several of the Southern Experiment Stations have been doing
useful work in showing the value and importunos oi the cotton
