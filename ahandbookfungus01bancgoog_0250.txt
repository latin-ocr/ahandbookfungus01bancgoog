370. Stenmlnp mamae lor cattle-Fifly years ago there
oould be found in this oountry a number of establishmenm, more
or less elaborate and expensive, designed for the purpose ot
steaming or boilIng forage for ·oattle. The work was usually
undertaken by men ol means, and was sometimes carried out
with muoh detail and osten at considerable expense. It is signil-
iount that none of these praetioes was long maintained.

Experiments with feeding steamed hay to oxen, made at Pop·
elsdorf,l shewed very deoisively that steamIng rendered the oom-
ponents of hay less digestible; especially was this true ol the
protein. When the hay was fed dry, 46 per oeni, ol the protein
was digested, while only 30 per rent. was digested from the
steamed hay. (664)

We may summarize the results ol oooking course forage for
cattle by quoting the reply to 66 inquiror given many years ago¹
by the editor of an agricultural 36666616ἱ “Τ66 advantages are
very slight and not worth the trouble of either building the lire,
cutting the wood or ereoting the apparatus, to say nothing of all
these combined, with danger and insuranoe added”

ing feed for swine. This subjeot has been earefully investigated
st our Stations with praetioally oonoordant results, so that we are
not without definite help on an important topic. Ι

loss of 6 per oent in the value ol the seed because of rooking.
