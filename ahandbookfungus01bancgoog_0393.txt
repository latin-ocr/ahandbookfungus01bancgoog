marbling oi the fat and lean was not equal to that oi the others
(bees breeds).'' Georgesom reviewing his results, writes: . . .
“ 'Phe Shorthorns gave the best returns, not simply because the
grues weight oi their carcasses was greater than that of the scrubs‚
hut also because their meat was esteemed betterby expertein the
paeking-house who were esked tojudge nithe quality and assign
prices’' Oi the Ontario native* Shaw wrote: “There was a

laclr of thickness of carcass throughout, the deficiency in depth of
rib and lein being very notieeable, and the absence of what may

be termed fleshiness was conspicuous”

577. ln cordesius-In our study oi the velue oi specificbreed-
ing for bees productiori wehave found, as shown in the preceding
articles, that the' steer bred for beel does not consume less seed
than do others oi the same weight, nor does he necessarily reach a
given wcight in less days, though generally such ie the casa Nor
do our figures show that 100 pounds of gain, live weight, can be
made by the beef steer with lese lece than other eettle require·

'Phe first specific differenee is found in the marked superiority
oi true bees cattle in yielding alarger percentageof dremed weight
to live carcaa A second difference oi deep significasse is in
the disposition ol the fat, the beel steer placing this surplus
material where it serves ils highest purpose as human foed-
among the muscular libers of the timum-while the dairy-bred
animal deposits it in quantity about the viscera ⁸

While ii we divide the dressed careum into the several parts
required by the trude we cannot show that the proportior oi these
varies in cattle of different breeds, yet the thickness oi the flcsh
of these parts is certainly in favor oi the beei breeds

These differences with others which cannot be distinctly speci·
fied coming under the term “ quality,” combine to make the beet
steer what his name indieates-an animal specifically designed
ior the most favorable productior oi the best meat
