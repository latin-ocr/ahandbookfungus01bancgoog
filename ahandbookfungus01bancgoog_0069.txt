'Phe formation of fat from carbohydrates was long considered
impossible because no intermediate steps in the transformation
were known. Iately, however, it has been found that butyric,
capronic and higher solid fatty acids are formed from carbohy·
drates in putrefactivo processes We have seen that the fatty
acide are readily taken up by the animal system and changed into
fats, which may be depositcd in the body or omnimo, according
to the supply oi nntrients and the nutritive condition of the
animal. (75) This being true, there is uo theoretical difficulty in
the way of the formation of the fat of milk from carbohydrates

a dog was poisoned with phosphorus after having been starved
twelve days It died seven days later. une excretion of urea
was quite constant from the fifth to the twelfth day of the experi-
ment, amounting to te grams daily. After the poisoning had
begun, the excretion increascd until it amounted to 23.9 grams
per day, i. a, three times the normal amount It was ascertained
with another dog treated the same way, but kept in a respiration
apparatus, that the excretion oi carbonic acid and the amount of
