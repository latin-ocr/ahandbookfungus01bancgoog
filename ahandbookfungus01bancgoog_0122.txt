with what may be called a “trial ” ration, composed oi two or
more kinds of coarse forage with a moderate supply of some
desirable concentrate. When the nutriente these furuish have
been placed in tabular form, a few trials will determine the
quantity oi other concontrates necessary to bring the ration up
to the standard. It is usually impossible to eompound ratione
ior ruminante from common American leading stuffs which will
furnish the large amount oi dry matter called ior by the Wolff-
Lehmaun standard. While volume is au important factor in
iaeding, it is better to allow the ration to fall below the standard
in dry matter than to add so much coarse ioraga with its large
percentage of inert matter. Our common faediug materiale are
oi such composition that in placing enough oi them in the ration
to furnish the requisita protein and carbohydrates, there is usually
an exoess of ether extract according to the standard, but this
cannot be avoided. There is no direct way oi calculating tha
exact quantities of the nutrientstobe used in formulating rations,
the desired result being reached only by repeated trinis, each
bringing the calculation nearer the dasired standard. With the
explanations given, the stockman should find no difficulty in
calculating rations for the farm animals under his aare.
