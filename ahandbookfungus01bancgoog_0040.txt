46. Veristion in digestibility oi teediog striis- The leading
quality of fecding south is digestibility. Milk is pmctically all
digestible. Most of the nutriente in corn meal yield to the
digestive solvente, while rye strav is of such character that a
large portion of its substance is indigestible, and therefore inort
in the elimentary tract In studying the dignetibility os a given
seed, the chemist first determines by analynis the percontage of
ench of the nutriente it contains Weighed quantitiee of the
seed ere then given to some animal and the solid excrement
conec during tne nin is saved, reigned ann samples of 'n
annlyzed. Knovving how much of each nutrient vves fed and
how much re-appeers in the solid excrement, the difference is
held to be the portion digested‚ since it must have been retained
in tho body.

47. Α digestion trid with sheep—As illustrating the manner
of conducting digestion niele, the following description is given
of one conducted by Armsby vrit-h sheep at the Wisoonsin
statione ¹Desiring to ascertain thedigostibility of clover hay
ond malt sprouts by sheep, two wethers veighing 87 ponnds each
were selected for the trial. They were closely confined in
separate apanments specially constructed for the purpose, and
t‘cd from rinc-lined seed bores anengcd to prevent the fodder
from being wasted. Eech day’s ration vas carefully weighed
ond samplcs received for anelysis The solid excrement as it
passed from the wethers was collected by means of rubber-lincd
begs attached tn the hind quarters of the animal by a light hcr-
