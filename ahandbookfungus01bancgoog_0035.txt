36. Theclrculotory system-The arteries are the tubes or
canals which carry the blood from the beart As these tubes
poss throughout the body they brcuch again end again, gradually
growing smaller, until they end in minute divisione called capil-
laries. 'Phe ends oi the capillaries connect in turn with the
veins, which carry the blood back to the henrt 'Phe purified
blood forced outward from the beart through the arteries reaches
the capillaries, through which portione escape to nourish the
tissucs os the body. Thai which is not lost through the capillos
ries, together with the impurities gothered on the way, returns to
tho henrt, whence it is forced to the lungs for purification. From
these it returns to the beart, to be again forced over the body.

37. Ibe {mollesce- Besides the circulatory system there is
a'seoond one which hrains the whole animal body toward the
heart only, called the “Lymphetic system.’' The broken-down
tissues of the body arc removed through the lymphatic system,
and the material thus drotum is called lymph. Lymph varies
in composition according to the stage ol activity ol the organs
contributing it and the locality from which it is taken. Lymph
ond chyle, the one worn-out material from the tissues ol the body,
the other fresh material from the digestive tract, ere poured
through the lymphatico into the venous system und on to the
beart, where they mingle with the blood current It is estimsted
thot for every 220 pounds body weight there ure ‘lo pounds of
lymph and 6 pounds of chyle formed daily.
