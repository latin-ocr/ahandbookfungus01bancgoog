striking variatione from the normal. The range of digestibility
due to species, breed, age and live veight does not, under ordi·
nary conditious, vary more thau from 2 to 4 per cent

51. Cocrse eud conceuusted teeds combined.— When thereis
added to a supply of course sodder substances rich iu protein,
such as oil rakc, oats, cta, the digestibility cf the coarsc fodder
is not therchy increased. The addition of a large quantity oi
curbohydrates, such as sugar and starch, to a ration of ooarsc
lbragc, may reduce the digestibility of the protein aud crude
liber of the forage. 'Phe depression in digestibility caused by
the addition ol the carbohydrates isuot apparent until the added
druch or sugar exaneda 10 per cent. oi the dry matter oi the
course toroge, but is marked by the time the addition reaches 30
per cent. For example, at Weende‚ when sheep veresed1.75
pounds of hay aud 8 cunces of starch per head daily, the diges-
tibility ol the protein was reduced imm 54 tc 32 per cent. 'l'he
depression is reduced or suspended by the addition oi a highly
uitrogeuous fceding stuff, such as oil oake. The addition of fat
to a ration does not decrease the digestibility ol the other constit-
uents Salt does not affect digestion, though it may increase
consumptiones fced and improve nutrition.

The student should not confouud the digestibility oi leading
stuffs with their final nutritive effect. While two animals may
each digest the same amount of nutriente from the seme veight
ofa given seed, one may give lar better returns lor the substances
taken intc the body than the other. The utilizatiou of the
nutrieuts of ieeding materiale is determined by the breed, indi-
viduality, condition of the uniuml, etc.

52. Artificis! digestione· While vigorously prosecutiug diges-
tion investigatione with animale, the chemist has not been idle iu
his efforts tc find an camier and more rapid methodos reaching
the sume end. Stutzer has proposed a simple method lor deter-
mining the digestibility ol protem, by treatiug the substance
under investigation with u'eok solutions oi pepsin aud afterwards
ot panoreatic huid, care being taken to maintaiu the digesting
uram at the normal temperature of the animal body. 'Phe fluids
named aet only on the protein of the lcod, hence this method
