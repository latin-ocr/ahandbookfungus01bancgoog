679. Α review oi the soblect- Reviewing the matter, it seems
from the data at hand that it is possible to vary the composition
ot eow's milk ior short periods by marked changes in the character
oi the seed supplied, there being an increase of one or two-tenths
ei one per cent oi fat when ieeds rich in protein are given,
though sometimes the change is the other way. 'Phe extensive
Danish investigatione conclusively show that the dairy iarmer
cannot hope to measurably increase the pereentuge oi tat in his
milk by any practicable system oi ieeding.

It is remarkable that dairymen have so generally held au er·
roneous opinion regarding the ability ot seed to permanently st-
iect the quality ot milk. They have donbtlem been led into this
erum because with any marked improvement ot the ration for the
eow there has always come alarger flow ot milk, and consequently
a larger total amount oi iat It would appear that the variatione
inthe fat perceiitage of milk are ostener brought aboutby nervous
influences than through the character of the teed supplied. Ilven
the variations found when first changing to new rations may be a
nervous rather than a feed effect, thus explaining why the change

is bnt temporary.

When the functiones milk is considered, the view here held as
to its stability of composition seeum rational. If the milk oi the
dam were subject to marked or violent fluctuatione, varying in
composition with every small change in quantity or quality of
leod-supply, the weltere oi the young animal receiving it would
