Influcnce os Feed oa cc Animal Body. 87

8 pounds of salt 'Phe pige were confined in pens, with small
yards at the rear for exercise. 'Phe ground in these yards was
covered with hoards to prevent the animale from rooting in the
earth and eating quantities oi it, as those not getting ashes or
bone meel would have done had opportunity offered. The
triade lasted from 84 to 128 days without any of the animale
dying or becoming sich, a surprising fact for the loto living
wholly on corn moal, salt and water.

115. what the triola tevestem-As the trials progressed it
became evident that none of the pigs were properly nurtured,
though the difference iu favor of those getting hone meal or ashes
was very marked. The pigs allowed neither ashes nor bone moal
were most plainly dwarted. It was evident that the corn meal,
salt and water did not supply all the elementa aasential to huild·
ing a normal framework of hone and muscle. These dwarts
became so fat that the j0wls and bellice of some of them nearly
touched the ground.

The pige getting ashes or bone meal grew very well for
some time, but toward the close of the trial they made only
fair gains, showing that the nutriente supplied were still too
limited in character to allow normal development. On daughter,
the several loto shewed no differeuce iu the proportion of fet
to loen, nor was there any differenee in the sizo or character
of the venons internal orgens. 'Phe hones, however, were a most
interesting stndy. In the earne manner as described in the pre·
ceding topic, the thigh hones of these pigs were broken in a teet
ing machine with the results shown below:
