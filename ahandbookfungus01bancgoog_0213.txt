windrows, and from these into b'unches or cocks before the dew

After sweating they are opened in tichos, which give off their
molsture rapidly, and the material is soon ready for the barn..
Hay curing in cocks is otton protected by muslin covers or caps,
which are uselul in protecting the hunches from rain.
