hold that certum feede or leod combinatione oauee the oow topro

of investigatione do not warraut their position

Iu 1869 Kiihu¹ wrote: “The system oi leading isone oi sec-
ondary importauoe for milk production3 the yield oi milk ie

light to heavy seed the supply does not increase iu proportiou to
the nutriente supplied. 'l'he same holds true where the iarmor
aims to increase any single componentes the milk, as fat, since
it is not possible to attaiu a one-sided increase oi this or any other
component in the milk hy changes in the system of feedmg. No

Iu later experimenta with palm-nat meai, where all the necessary

Numerone investigatione, direct aud indireot, on thie point
