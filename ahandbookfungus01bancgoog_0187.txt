incurred by the operation, for the steers can es well perform the
work. The same statement holds true in some measure for dairy
cows An ear of corn with the husks still about it posseoees an
aroma which is largely lost when it is thrown into the crib, where
it is often polluted by vermin. Thst cattle appreciata the fresh·
neoe of unhusked coru is shown by the eugerness with which
they search the stalks for ears Whoever hus watched a cow
searching through a bundle of stover for a possible ear or nubbiu
of corn which the would-he thrifty former has hy accident over·
looked, cannot fail to be impressed with the folly of the fermer iu
so earefully performing his worlr. It is true that when fed in this
manner some corn will pass through the animal unbroken‚ bnt
feeding trials have shown that despite such waete there is usually
profit in the systm over that of hnskiug and reduoiug the oorn
to meal. A part of the corn can be husked to furnish grain for
other purposes, and the remainder of the crop left for the cattle.
Bya little study to ascenain the amount of grain the shocks
carry, the foeder can soon adj ust the supply of corn to forage so
us to give each animal its proper allowanoo of grain along with
the fodder. Because one’s ancestors laboriously husked coru aud
afterwards divided the crop with the miller for grinding is no
reason why in those later days of high-priced labor and low-
priced products we should still be huslring comior cattle, when
these animals have all day in which to do the work and willingly

Because only a portion of the nutriment has gone into the ear,
the stalks of fodder corn are more nutritione and palatable than
novor, which hus lost much of its substance to the grain it pro·

In feeding fodder corn to horses care should be taken that they
do not get too much grain3 otherwise there isno better fo1age for
them. Corn fodder‚ in which the ears have been choked to half
or less than half their normal sine by thick plauting‚ is one of the
most valuable forms of roughage for dairy sowa, steers in the first
stages of fattening‚ and young cattle. All the corn those animala
