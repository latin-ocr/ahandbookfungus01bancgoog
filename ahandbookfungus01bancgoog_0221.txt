It will be seen that the orude fiber, the poorest part of the hay,
was inoremd, und the protein and nitrogen-free extract, the
more vuluable portione, were materially reduced by weathering.

305. mulla ln the eastern dubod statee- Attempts to grow
“ alfalfa inthe Eastern states have generally ended in failure. 'rho

wonderful results obtained in the West have served to keep alive

· an intereat in this plant and stimulated renewed triels from

tirno to time. 'Phe results obtained by several Stations show that
large returns ere possible under favorable eondltions In search-
ing for the oauses of feilure, it appears thet the most general one
is insufficient oure in seouring a good stand of plante 'Po reaeh
this end tho ground seeded to alfalfa must be free from weed·
seeds so that tho young planto, which are wealr when they first
spring up, may grow untremmeled. 'Phe desired end will be ae·
eompliohed by summer-following the proposed altelfa field for one
senson in order to reduoe the soil to proper fineness, and especially
to sprout and kill all weed-seeds lying near the surfaoe. 'Phe
following spring sow from twenty to thirty pounds of allalfa seed
in drills or oover lightly with a harrow.

306. muner of prowm- The alfulfa plaut is a grone foeder,
its tap root reaching many feet into the soil. Headden‚ of tho
Colorado Station,¹ found alfalfa roots twelve and one-half feet
below the surfaoe. This indicates that the plant should heve e
subsoil through which the roots may pass, with water not nearer
