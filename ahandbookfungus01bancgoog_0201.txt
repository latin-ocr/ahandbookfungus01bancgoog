neck farms, for the yield of forage is too small to warrant adher·
ence to this crop alone for farm-horse seed. Fodder corn, hay '
from the cereale, and- ‘bright straw are substitutes that may be
fed with economy and mdsfaelion to all horses not required for
road work.

Timothy meadows afford bnt little affermaih, and if pastured
at all closely this grass is easily destroyed. Red clover should be
grown with timothy‚ if possible, for the combination furnishes a
superior hay both in quantity and quality ior many purposes
When grown together, the hay produced the first season after
seediug will eonsist largely of clover. Many oi the clover roots
die ab the end of this season, and the nutrimeut from thess
nourishes the timotby plante, which spring into aseendency the
second seasou, yielding a hay in which clover forms the smaller
portion (478) .

269. drehsrd 9111111- This grass starts very early in the spring
and ripens about two weeks in advenae of timothy. For this rea-
son it mociates well with red clover. Hay from orchard grass
‘is inclined to be harsh, woody and lacking in aroma, and is not
particularly relished by stock. These defects can be partially
overcome by cutting the grass very early. Orchard grass does
not form an even, dense sod, but grows in tutis or tussoeks, for
which reason it should not be sown alone, bnt with other grasses
and with clovers Mixed with other grassea orchard grass serves
a useful purpose in pasturas, and under favorable conditions will
hold its own indefinitely.

Traey, oi the Mississippi Station,¹ reporta 'orchard grass as
making a better winter growth on heavy clay soils than any other
speeies tested. In that region it commences growth in February
aud yields hay in May.

2⁷⁰. lledtop.— This widely disseminated grass of several spe·
eies is especially valuable on (lump, low lands, where it forms
a close turs, furnishing excellent pastura and a valuable hay,
composed of fine stems and rather numerous leaves Redtop
appears indigenous to Northern meadows and should be more
generally grown wherever the land is suitable.
