For present purposes we may assume that the flesh lying over
the sixth rib isrepresentative of the whole carcesa This being
true„ the careasses of the protein-ied pigs contained eight parts
more water and ten parts less fat to the hundred pounds than the
oareasees of the pigs fed corn. For dry lean meat the results are
a little more than six per cent for the corn-fed pigs end above
eight per cent ior the other lots There was, then, about one·
third more lean meat in the cartenses of the protein-fed pigs than
in the earcasses of those getting corn The analysis reveals more
