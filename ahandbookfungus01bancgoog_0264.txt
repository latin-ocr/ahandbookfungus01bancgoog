The difference in favor of silage is probably due in part to tho
fact that cattle umtally reJect the dry butte oi the corn nait,
even when out fine, while in silage uis· part is readily eatan.-
Thus, with a given amount oi sorage of either kind, somewhat
more of that in the form ossilago is consumed. Again, silage is
more acceptable to stock than dry fodder, and a larger amount
oi dry mat-ter is consumed in the same time, which conducas to
greater gains in desh or larger yields of milk. Because the aui-
mal willingly eats mure food in the shape of adauge, there is more
nutriment leit to form milk or flesh aster the wauts of the body
