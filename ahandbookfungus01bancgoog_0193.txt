tor sowing the seed and gethering the harvest from which prov·
ender for the next seeson is to come.

It is a fact which cannot escape the attention of students oi
agricultural economica, that our stockmen rely too blindly upon
pastores ior the maintenanoe oi their cattle during hali the year.
But a few centurias ago the inhabitants of Great Britain trusted
to the growth of natural herbage sor the support of their stock not
only in summer but throughout the entire year. If their animala,
foraging ior themselves as best they could, survived the winter,
all was well; if they died from starvation, it was an “act of
God.'' We have abandoned the crude practices oi our anccstors,
and now carefully stone in barns abundance of provender for
leading floclrs and herda during winter’s rigor. We are amazed
that our ancestors were so improvident as to gether no winter
seed for their cattle, while ior ours great barns are built and storcd
with provender. By turning cattle to pasture in spring and let
ting them forage as bem they may until winter we show that all
the barbaric blood has not yet been eliminated from our veins. Ii
the summer rains are timely and abundant, the cattle are well
nourished on these pasturas, if drought prevails they suffer for
food as surely, and osten m severely, as did the live stock of
England in winter, ages ago. To suffering trem scant food there
is added the heat of “dog days” and the ever-present annoyance
of blood-secking dies Onr atockmen will never be worthy of
their calling, nor their flocks and herds yield their bem returns,
until ample provision is made against droughtruined pasturas in
summer. Every argument which stands in favor of storing
provender ior moal( in winter holds with equal force for providing
toed to make good any possible shortage of pasturas in summer.
