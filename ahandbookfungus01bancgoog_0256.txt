242 . Foeda ond Foediny.

Summarizing the preeeding data, we have: When foeding oorn
forage with hay nnd grain, the eows getting-

3‚538 pounds shredded etover or render produoed 3, 7⁰4 pounde ol milk.
illd? pounde umhredded etover or iodder pmdueed 3, 730 pouude oi milk.

ifwe count the milk returns equal ior the two lota-though
they are slightly in favor of the eows getting the shredded fod-
der‚—we have a naving of 24 per oent. of eoru forage by using it
iu ehredded form.

Here are different results from those secured by Shelton. How
ean they be harmonizedi In the first place, the stalks used by
Shelton were mueh eoarser and harsher than those grown in Wis-
oonsin, and it is probable that his cattle were offered meh liberal
quantitiee oi forage that they naturally ehose the aefter portione,
wanting the remainder. Again, it is possible that the sharp edgee
oi the fine-eut eoru stailrn made the mouths of the cattle sore, so
that they eonld notent forage as they otherwise would.
