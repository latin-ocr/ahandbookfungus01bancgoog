‚hydrete group, the hydrogen atoms are not always tuine the

of several simple oils the prinoipal of which, with their formuhe,

are us follows:
Steerin ΟΗΗΗΟΟο

Palmitin OMHWO⁸
Olein ΟΗΗΜΟο

Oils give off much more beat during eombustion than the ear·
bohydrates because they oontain a relativelylarger quantity of
carbon. While found in nearly ull parts of the plaut, the oils aud

wheat and eom eontain some fats or oils.

9. Proteia oonpoonda- Thus far we have oonsiderad the
plant edmpounds whiob result from the union of the three ele·
ments, corbon, hydrogeu end oxygeu. We now eome to a more
complex group of plant substauees containing two additional ele·
ments, viz.² nitmgen and sulfur. 1t is held that the nitrafes
tehen up through the roots of planta on reaohing the protoplasmie
masses iu the aetive cells ere broken up, and the nitrio aoid eud
sulfur are united with staroh or a mamb derivative, forming a
protem eompouud. Pmtein substnuees may be produeed in pro·
toplusmie messes whioh may or may not eonteiu chlorophyll 'fhe
protoplasm of aetive cells where the work of omimilatiou goes
on, is itself a protein substance. Very little protein is found iu
the woody‚ older portione of the plant, the greater amount existing
at the point of growth and iu the eeede or repmduetive ports In
the seed the protein existe quite largely iu the germ itself‚ and
also iu the surrounding envelopee For a defiuitiou of protein,
see Glossary. The protein eompounds of plante am divided into
two groups-albumiuoids and amides.

10. ῘΙιο eibnminoida- One group of protein substauees is
eharaeterized by the term “albuminoids’l Vegetable albu·
men elosely resembles the white of egg, and like it, is eoagulated
by beot Gluten, another albuminoid‚ is found in the wheat
grain. It may be separated from the starehy portion of wheat
flour by washing the dough in running water, the stioky mass
