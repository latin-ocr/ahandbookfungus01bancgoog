the proper time for turning stears ιο grass, each with points of
advantage. It is generally advocated by American writers that

ration of the seed-lot is at once out off, in which case the change
isso violent as ιο give the cattle a serious set-back. Under the
other system the cattle are turned to pastura as soon as the grass
begins to grow, and while the springing blades are still watery
and furnish little nutriment 'Phe lach of faed in tha pastura
forces the stoclr to rely on the faed rach ιο satisiy hunger. While
the first grass yialds little nutn'mant, it still has an effectori the
digestiva system and preparas the animal gradually for the change
from dry faed ιο tha rich grass which soon follows It is a well-
known fact that stoolr shrink badly when changed from feod-
lot ιο pastura, and it is possible that tha practice of turning
, early ιο grass, attha same time lreeping up heavy feeding, is
better than holding cattle langeron dry food only and then shift·
ing at once ιο full pastura. In any event let grain and some
dry forage bc still offered the cattle when first turned ιο grass '

small pasturas is frequently discussed. 'l'he majority of experi-
auaed American foedera favor a single larga range rather than
numerous small pasturas Grasses, both in variety and quality,
are never quite the same over the whole of a larga pastura, and
cattle soon deteot the slight differances and satisfy their desire for
variety by rauging from one spot ιο another. In large pasturas
the habits of tha animala become regular, and icis interesting ιο
study their movements The hard will be found in the morning
on one side of the valley‚ leading on the more abundant vegeta-
tion; later as the sun’s heat increases they appear on the hill·-
sido, where there is a movement of air and where the grassae are
shorter but more nutritious3 while at noon they are ιο ba seen
resring in the shade at still another point. 'Phia regularity in
grazing cemainly condures to comfort and quiet and is of impor-
tanee ιο profitable returns. Where the pastores are cut up into

several lois, tha fresh bite of rank herbage which comes with each
